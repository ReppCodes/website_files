title: OMSCS Notes
---

I completed my MSCS at Georgia Tech, in their OMSCS program.  For some classes I was able to post notes about my lectures and projects.  This is mostly for my own benefit, but hopefully proves useful for future students or those merely curious about
the program.  Classes without notes were either simple enough that I didn't find much benefit from taking rigorous notes, or hard enough that I just didn't have the time and energy to take/transcribe them to a reasonable level of quality.
