I"s<p>I enjoy offensive cybersecurity a great deal, and spend quite a bit of time reading up and going after various CTFs.  This section of my website
will initially house CTF writeups from HackTheBox.  If and when I get a bit more serious about it, Iâ€™ll also post whatever bug bounty or other security research
findings I have here.  Stay tuned!</p>
