I"I	<p>For Spring 2021, my fifth semester, I chose to take CS6210: Advanced Operating Systems.  This class addresses a broad range of topics in operating system design and implementation, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operating system structuring</li>
  <li>Synchronization, communication and scheduling in parallel systems</li>
  <li>Distributed systems, their communication mechanisms, distributed objects and middleware</li>
  <li>Failures and recovery management</li>
  <li>System support for Internet-scale computing</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose to take this class due to my ongoing interest in systems programming, low-level design, and optimization.  It also followed quite well on having taken the Intro to OS course immediately prior, which will (hopefully) help reduce some of the remedial catch-up work I frequently need to do given my non-traditional background in CS.</p>

<p>The theoretical material in the lectures and exams is augmented with rather large and complex projects in C and C++.  There are four of these projects:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Virtual Machine Scheduling in KVM</li>
  <li>Barrier Synchronization</li>
  <li>Distributed Service using GRPC</li>
  <li>Implement MapReduce Framework using GRPC</li>
</ol>

<p>I switched jobs towards the end of the semester, and between that and the final project being a monster my class notes are incomplete.  Iâ€™ve posted here what I managed to take, both for my own future reference and in case even partial notes might be helpful to someone.</p>
