I"<p>For Fall 2021, my seventh semester, I chose to take CS6263: Intro to Cyber Physical Systems Security.  This class provides an introduction to security issues relating to various cyber-physical systems including industrial control systems</p>

<p>I chose to take this class partially due to my ongoing interest in the infosec industry, and partially because it overlaps very strongly with my new job and I figured a bit of additional training wouldn’t be a bad idea.</p>

<p>The theoretical material in the lectures and exams is augmented with 4 “mini projects” using a variety of tools:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Factory IO and block diagram programming</li>
  <li>Ladder logic programming using OpenPLC</li>
  <li>Mininet, Python, Wireshark</li>
  <li>Assembly x86, C, GDB debugger</li>
</ol>
