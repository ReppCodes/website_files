I"„<p>My day job is as a data scientist for a prominent healthcare company, and Iâ€™ve done a few such roles in a row.  Being a data scientist in the healthcare space
tends to be a bit more, shall we say â€˜practicalâ€™, than in pure tech firms.  That said, you do get the chance to have an actual positive impact on peopleâ€™s wellbeing, so thatâ€™s
quite nice.  Iâ€™m a big proponent of FOSS and its power to elevate the community, so whenever I build something that I think might do so I hope to write it up here.</p>

<p>Currently there are a lot of healthcare analysts being asked to generate things like HEDIS or URAC measures for the first time, and the tools in their box are historically
SQL and Excel.  When they look online, if theyâ€™re lucky a lot of what they find are fairly dense SAS conference papers.  I hope that stumbling here and finding some open source
solutions for what they need will be of some help.  At minimum this serves as proof I can actually code (hello potential future healthcare employers!).</p>
