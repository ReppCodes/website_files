I"R<p>I am a current student at Georgia Tech, in their OMSCS program.  I am a couple semesters in, but going forward I will be posting
notes about my lectures and projects.  This is mostly for my own benefit, but hopefully proves useful for future students or those merely curious about
the program.</p>
