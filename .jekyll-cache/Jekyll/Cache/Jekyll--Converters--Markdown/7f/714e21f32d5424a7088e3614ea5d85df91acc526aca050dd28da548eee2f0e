<p>Hi, my name is Andrew. This is my personal website, where I house articles about my pet projects, class notes, miscellaneous ramblings, and whatever else I feel like.  All opinions expressed here are my own and not representative of my employer or affiliates.  Enjoy your stay, I hope you find something to interest you!</p>

<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3>
<p>I’m a computer nerd with a variety of interests.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I currently work as a Software Engineer for a cybersecurity startup, mostly focusing on backend stuff.  Python, Javascript, Redis, regexes for days.</li>
  <li>Before this I worked as a data scientist in the healthcare space, for about 10 years.</li>
  <li>I am currently a student at Georga Tech in the OMSCS program.  I’m incredibly proud to be part of that institution.</li>
  <li>I really enjoy cybersecurity and CTFs.  I take runs at HackTheBox whenever I find some free time.  I hope to continue to develop my chops in this arena.</li>
</ul>
