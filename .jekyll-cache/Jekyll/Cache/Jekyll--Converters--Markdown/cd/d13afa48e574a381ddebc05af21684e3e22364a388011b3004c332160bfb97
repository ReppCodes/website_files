<h2 id="ten-security-principles">Ten Security Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Economy of mechanism
    <ul>
      <li>complexity is the enemy of security.  keep it simple</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fail-safe defaults
    <ul>
      <li>the default configuration should have a conservative protection scheme</li>
      <li>e.g. minimal access rights keeps user-level damage low</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Complete mediation
    <ul>
      <li>every access to a resource must be checked for compliance</li>
      <li>things like caching permissions are <em>scary</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open design
    <ul>
      <li>security should be publicly available for better scrutiny of security</li>
      <li>only secrets should be secret</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Separation of privilege
    <ul>
      <li>multiple conditions should be required to get at protected things</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Least privilege
    <ul>
      <li>what it says on the tin.  compromise is kept cheaper if your lost password only gets at your stuff</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Least common mechanism
    <ul>
      <li>if multiple users share a computer they should have separate accounts</li>
      <li>avoid sharing stuff wherever possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Psychological acceptability
    <ul>
      <li>if security makes no sense or is hard or jarring, people will avoid using it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Work factor
    <ul>
      <li>keep in mind your threat model, scope security measures appropriately to avoid wasting resources you might need elsewhere</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compromise recording
    <ul>
      <li>sometimes it is more desirable to record details of an intrustion</li>
      <li>e.g., affording IP cameras is maybe better than a fleet of guards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cryptographic-concepts">Cryptographic concepts</h2>
<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a means to allow two parties, customarily called Alice and Bob, to establish confidential communication over an insecure channel that is subject to eavesdropping</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cryptosystem-characteristics">Cryptosystem Characteristics</h3>
<p>Can be described by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the set of possible plaintexts</li>
  <li>the set of possible ciphertexts</li>
  <li>the set of encryption keys</li>
  <li>the set of decryption keys</li>
  <li>the correspondence between encryption keys and decryption keys</li>
  <li>the encyrption algorithm to use</li>
  <li>the decryption algorithm to use</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symmetric-cryptosystems">Symmetric Cryptosystems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Alice and Bob share a secret key, which is used for both encryption and decryption</li>
  <li>key distribution requires each pari of communicating parties to share a separate secret key</li>
  <li>requires ((n * (n-1) )/ 2) keys</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="public-key-cryptography">Public-Key Cryptography</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Uses public keys for encryption, private keys for decryption</li>
  <li>Only one key is needed for each recipient, with public and private components, n key pairs</li>
  <li>Can also be used to provide non-repudiation via signatures.  Use a private key to sign/encrypt, anyone can then use public key to decrypt for confirmation
    <ul>
      <li>Can also sign hash instead, slightly more secure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cryptographic-hash-functions">Cryptographic Hash Functions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A compression function that maps an arbitrary-length file/input to a fixed-length hash/output</li>
  <li>To be considered “cryptographic” a hash function must have the following properties
    <ul>
      <li>Must be “one-way”, e.g. it is simple to compute the hash given  an input, but very difficult to get the input given only the hash</li>
      <li>Should be collision-resistant, meaning that it should be very difficult to find two inputs that give the same hash output</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Message authentication codes
    <ul>
      <li>MAC enables data integrity, generated using hash function and a shared secret</li>
      <li>similar to salting password hashes</li>
      <li>recomputing hash with secret will show if file has been changed</li>
