<ul>
  <li>Devices interface with the rest of the system via a controller that’s integrated as part of the device packaging</li>
  <li>Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
    <ul>
      <li>Common architecture is PCI Express (PCIe)
        <ul>

<h3 id="device-drivers">Device Drivers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>OS’s support devices via device drivers</li>
  <li>Device Drivers
    <ul>
      <li>per each device type</li>
      <li>Responsible for device access,  management, and control
        <ul>
          <li>includes how instructions can be passed from higher level systems like the kernal or applications to the actual device</li>
          <li>includes how the system should respond to device-level events like errors or notifications</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>provided by device manufacturers per OS/version</li>
      <li>each OS standardizes interfaces to device drivers
        <ul>
          <li>so that the manufacturers can stay within a framework</li>
          <li>this achieves device independence – the OS does not need to be specialized for any given device</li>
          <li>this achieves device diversity – any device manufacturer can write a driver for any given OS knowing there’s a standardized interface

<h3 id="types-of-devices">Types of Devices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To deal with such device diversity, devyces are usually grouped into types</li>
  <li>Block: Disk
    <ul>
      <li>read/write blocks of data</li>
      <li>direct access to arbitrary block</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Character: Keyboard
    <ul>
      <li>get/put characters</li>
      <li>serial sequence of characters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Network Devices
    <ul>
      <li>kind of a special case, somewhere between block and character.  stream of data chunks, sometimes of different sizes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>OS representation of a device == special device file
    <ul>
      <li>allows any other existing OS file mechanisms to interact with devices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unix-like systems
    <ul>
      <li>all devices appear as files under /dev directory</li>
      <li>handled by special filesystem, not the normal one
        <ul>
          <li>tmpfs</li>
          <li>devfs</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cpu-device-interactions">CPU-Device Interactions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The main way PCI makes devices available to the CPU is to represent these devices’ registers in a way similar to how the CPU accesses memory</li>
  <li>Device registers appear to the CPU as memory locations at a specific physical address</li>
  <li>Memory-mapped I/O
    <ul>
      <li>part of ‘host’ physical memory is dedicated for device interactions</li>
      <li>Base Address Registers (BAR) – control this dedicated memory</li>
      <li>Configured during boot process and determined by PCI configuration protocol</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I/O port model
    <ul>
      <li>dedicated in/out CPU instructions for device access</li>

<h4 id="path-from-device-to-cpu">Path from Device to CPU</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The path from the device to the CPU can take 2 routes
    <ul>
      <li>Interrupt
        <ul>
          <li>devices can generate interrupts to CPU</li>
          <li>Pros
            <ul>
              <li>can be generated as soon as possible</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Cons
            <ul>
              <li>interrupt handling steps generate overhead in several ways</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Polling
        <ul>
          <li>CPU can poll devices by reading their status registers</li>
          <li>Pros
            <ul>
              <li>can be done when convenient for OS</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Cons
            <ul>
              <li>either delay or additional CPU overhead depending on implementation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Choosing between them will depend on a variety of charteristics
    <ul>
      <li>type of device</li>
      <li>interrupt complexity</li>
      <li>overall load on the system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="device-access--pio">Device Access – PIO</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Programmed I/O == PIO</li>
  <li>Requires no additional hardware support</li>
  <li>CPU issues instructions by writing into the command registers of the device</li>
  <li>CPU controls data movement by accessing data registers of the device</li>
  <li>Example: NIC, data == network packet
    <ul>
      <li>write command to request packet transmission</li>
      <li>copy packet to data registers</li>
      <li>repeat until packet set
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. 1500b packet; 8byte regs or bus
            <ul>
              <li>1 (for bus command) + ~188 for data =&gt; ~189 CPU store instructions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="direct-memory-access-dma">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Alternative to PIO</li>
  <li>Relies on special hardware support – DMA controller</li>
  <li>CPU “programs” the device
    <ul>
      <li>via command registers</li>
      <li>via DMA controls</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Example: NIC
    <ul>
      <li>write command to request packet transmission</li>
      <li>configure DMA controller with in-memory address and size of packet buffer
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. 1500B w/ 8 byte regs or bus =&gt; 1 store instruction + 1 DMA configure</li>
          <li>less steps, but DMA config is morec complex
            <ul>
              <li>therefore, for smaller transfer PIO is better than DMA, as DMA configu takes many cycles</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For DMAs:
    <ul>
      <li>data buffer must be in physical memory until transfer completes
        <ul>
          <li>cannot swap it out to disk, as DMA controller can only interact with physical memory</li>
          <li>this is done with pinning regions (non-swappable pages)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="typical-device-access">Typical Device Access</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Typical ways a user process interacts with a device:
    <ol>
      <li>system call to kernel</li>
      <li>in-kernel stack for target device</li>
      <li>device request configuration
        <ul>
          <li>driver knows all the specific device things, it will handle minutae</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Device performs request</li>
      <li>call chain is then traversed in a reverse manner back up to user process

    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="os-bypass">OS Bypass</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is not actually necessary to go through the kernel to get to a device
    <ul>
      <li>Some devices can be configured to be directly access from User Level</li>
      <li>This is called OS Bypass</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>OS Bypass
    <ul>
      <li>device registers and/or data directly accessible</li>
      <li>OS does the configuration then gets out of the way</li>
      <li>Jump straight from user process to device driver</li>
      <li>requires a user-level driver library for user process to talk to device driver.  equivalent to kernel device drivers</li>
      <li>OS retains coarse-grain control, such as enable/disable or add/remove permission</li>
      <li>relies on device features
        <ul>
          <li>device must have sufficient registers so that OS can map some registers to user process but still retain access to whatever registers that are used for configuration and control</li>
          <li>must also be able to share the device across multiple user processes</li>
          <li>demux capability
            <ul>
              <li>one device wants to send data back to one of multiple user processes, the device must be able to figure out how to correctly send desired data to target process’ address space</li>
              <li>this means the device must be able to look inside data to understand where it should go</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In normal device usage path, kernel would normally handle all of this, putting less burden on the device and libraries</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ioctl() command on Linux

<h3 id="sync-vs-async-access">Sync vs Async Access</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When an I/O request is made, usually the user process need a response from the device, even just an acknowledgement</li>
  <li>What happens to the user process while waiting on that response?
    <ul>
      <li>Synchronous
        <ul>
          <li>user process blocks, placed on wait queueu</li>

      <li>Asynchronous
        <ul>
          <li>process continues</li>
          <li>later:
            <ul>
              <li>process checks and retrieves result</li>
              <li>OR process is notified that the operation completed and the results are ready</li>
              <li>similar to interrupt vs polling tradeoffs</li>

      <li>leverages locality of data on disk</li>
      <li>e.g. if you’re given an instruction to read block 17, also read/cache blocks 18 and 19 because they’re likely to be needed too</li>
      <li>This does add some overhead by adding additional read volume and cache size that may not be needed, but on balance is usually a net win</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Journaling/Logging =&gt; reduce random access
    <ul>
      <li>“describe” write in a log: block, offset, value, etc</li>
      <li>periodically apply updates to proper disk locations</li>
      <li>this provides safety and stability to the reorder process, as it allows any reordered but not yet performed disk writes to be kept track of</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
