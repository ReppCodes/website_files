# Principle of Abstraction

## Introduction

-   Most computers will have multiple applications open.  How do they all work together?
-   OS's have evolved over time.  We will see some of how the current state of the art has come about.
-   Abstractions!
    -   hardware resources
    -   OS functionality
    -   OS abstractions
-   By end of the lesson, we will be ready to discuss the primary OS abstractions
-   Lots of review of basics OS stuff.  Going to omit many of these slides from notes

-   Abstraction is an interface that allows us to hide all the details


## The power of abstractions

-   Google Earth, at some level, is electrons and holes.
-   An ascending list of all the abstractions might be:
    -   Transistors
    -   Logic Gates
    -   Sequential and combination logic elements
    -   machine organization (data path and control)
    -   Instruction set architecture
        -   abstraction defined by a processor (Intel Inside, yo)
    -   System software
        -   OS, compilers, etc
    -   Applications
        -   high level language that leverages **all** lower layers

-   Application is written at the top of the hierarchy, and traverses the stack below it.  The stack below it provides all it needs for successful and safe execution

# Hardware Resources

-   OS role is to control access to the physical hardware
-   Hardware ranges from smartphone to cloud servers, but really they're all pretty similar in terms of internal organization
    -   same for all manifestations
        -   CPU is connected by a conduit we call the Bus
        -   Memory has instructions and data needed for CPU to execute.  CPU uses Bus to access memory
        -   Storage is needed for persistence of files, and other data.  Also accessed by CPU via a Controller, attached to the Bus
        -   Peripherals such as mic/keyboard/etc all accessed via Controllers attached the Bus
        -   Network is interfaced through Controller/Bus, same as everything else
        -   Bus is a conduit for communication, serves the purpose of connecting CPU to other components
        -   Depending on sophistication/speed of device may have various other capabilities
            -   e.g. network or storage may access memory directly (DMA)
    -   Second example given, with a system bus in addition to the IO bus
        -   System bus is for synchronous communication between CPU and Memory
        -   IO bus is for the devices to communicate with the CPU
        -   The intent is that the individual needs of these devices is less than the cumulative bandwidth for the CPU to communicate with the memory.  System bus > IO bus
        -   System bus connects via a bridge to the IO bus
        -   Bridge is a specialized IO processor for scheduling the devices to communicate with the memory (DMA) or the CPU
        -   Other high end devices, such as frame buffer for a graphics display, that may hang off the system bus to take advantage of its high-speed nature

# OS Functionality

-   Section begins with a 'quiz' that lists some of the functionalities provided by an OS
    -   OS is a resource manager
    -   OS provides a consistent interface to the hardware resources (CPU, memory, etc)
    -   OS schedules applications on the CPU
-   What is an OS?
    -   Protected access to hardware resources
    -   Arbitrates among competing requests
    -   ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/aos/L01_img3.png)
    -   OS provides well defined APIs for accessing hardware resources managed by the OS
        -   resources are provided as services
        -   applications make requests for resources to the OS
        -   services are provided as responses to those API calls
-   What happens when you click the mouse on your computer?
    -   It generates a CPU interrupt
        -   using an interrupt line, one of the lines on the bus
        -   ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/aos/L01_img4.png)
    -   CPU is running whatever else.  An interrupt is a hardware mechanism for alerting the processor that something external requires the attention of the CPU.  OS fields the interrupt.
    -   OS schedules itself to run on the CPU to handle the interrupt, figures out what its intended for, and passes it to the intended recipient program for action.

# Managing the CPU and Memory

-   Recall the initial imagery from beginning of this lecture, where a computer is running multiple apps seemingly simultaneously, and all of them must play nicely with each other.
-   OS must protect these applications from one another and themselves, while staying out of the way as much as possible.


## Catering to Resource Requirements

-   Resource needs of applications
    -   cpu
    -   memory
    -   peripheral devices
-   App launch time
    -   OS doesn't know much about the app, but at least has enough information to create memory footprint
        -   this is provided by the OS loader
        -   ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/aos/L01_img5.png)
    -   app asks for additional resources at runtime, OS will serve as broker for running applications


## Modern Operating Systems

-   Program
    -   static image loaded into memory
-   Process
    -   a program in execution
    -   program + state of the running program (which evolves as the program executes)
    -   in the simplest examples, there is a single thread of control coursing through the program
    -   However, picture two (or many) threads of control running parallel through the program
    -   The OS must arbitrate between competing requests from these threads
    -   Therefore a process = program + state of all threads executing in the program
-   Memory related OS abstraction
    -   address space for each process distinct from one another
    -   implement the abstraction using hardware capabilities
