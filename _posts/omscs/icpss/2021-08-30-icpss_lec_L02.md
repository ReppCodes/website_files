# Overview
* Broadly, CPS's are systems that integrate computing into the physical world
* Advances in digital technology have led to a huge increas in the number of systems spanning the digital/physical gap (CPS's)

## Examples and Definitions
### Cyber Systems
* Personal computers
* Mobile phones
* Embedded Devices

### Physical Systems
* Motors
* Pumps
* Generators
* Valves
* Relays

### Cyber Physical Systems
* Integrations of computation with physical processes
	* Lee
* Embedded systesm together with their physical environment
	* Marwedel

* An important distinction between physical and cyber is the non-reversibility or preemption of actuator operations.  No rolling back an actuation.
* Normally CPS's must act in real time
	* RTOS!
	* Open- and closed-loop control

* Lots of overlap and interrelationships between CPS and more well-known terms
	* IOT can generally be thought of as CPS's, for example

## Example CPS Industries
### Smart Manufacturing
* Leverage embedded technology to improve safety, effciency, etc

### Emergency Response
* Medium/large scale
* Handling the threats against public safety, and protecting nature and valuable infrastructures

### Air Transportation
* Large scale
* Operation and traffic management of aircraft systems
* It is expected that smart vehicles (such as drones) will be predominant in the near future

### Healthcare
* Medium scale
* Monitoring health conditions of the patients and taking necessary actions
	* E.g. pacemakers and more modern equivalents
	* Support for in-home care and assisted living

### Intelligent Transportation
* Medium/Large scale
* Improving safety, coordination and services in t raffic management and real-time info sharing
* Support communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and devices in the near future

### Service Robots
* Small/medium scale
* Performing services for the welfare of humans

### Building Automation
* Small/medium scale
* Provides optimum control and automation of HVAC, lighting, etc

### Critical Infrastructure
* Large scale
* Distribution of daily life supplies such as water, electricity, gas, oil

## CPS Challenges

## Challenges for Securing CPS's
* Many CPS are becoming more vulnerable to computer attacks for many reasons
	* Need example adversary models for CPS
	* Fundamentlaly different problems encountered in CPS as compared to traditional IT security

### Adversary Models
* A systematic study of the security of any system requires the description of the threats we expect to face
* Developing an adversary model is a way to understand the scope of the problem and assess the risks
* Example models
	* Cybercriminals (the usual suspects).  Attacks may not be targeted, but can stil cause camage
	* Disgruntled employees
	* Terrorists, activists, and organized criminal groups
		* No currently available public information about this happening yet, but some indicators
	* Nation States
		* e.g. notpetya, stuxnet

## Maintaining Control of CPS

### Countermeasures
* Better understand the consequences of an attack
* Design novel attack-detection algorithms
* Design new attack-resilient algorithms and architectures

### Prevention
* Regulation
* Standards (both use and enforcement)
	* shotout to NERC and NIST
* Best practices

### Detection and Recovery
* Control systems can provide a paradigm shift for intrusion detection
	* e.g. monitoring physical systems directly may reveal attacks we could not detect from the IT side
* Provide information awareness to operators of control systems
* Ideas from control theory such as reconfiguration or fault-detection and isolation can be leveraged

### Resilience
* Redundancy
* Separation of privilige
* Operate using open loop control
	* under false data injection attack, system should be able to operate using open loop control for a significant amount of time

### Deterrence
* Successful legislation
* Law enforcement
* International collaboration
