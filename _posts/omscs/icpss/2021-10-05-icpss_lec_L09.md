# Industrial Network Protocols
* Highly specialized protocols, designed for efficiency and reliability
* Common requirements include:
	* Real-time synchronization
	* Deterministic communication
* Many of these protocols forego security in order to meet ICS requirements 
* Protocols deployed across Industrial networks
	* Including WAN, business networks, plant and SCADA networks, and fieldbus networks
* Many of these protocols were only over serial channels, but have now evolved to work over ethernet using routable protocols
* For the most part, we can divide industrial protocols into two common categories
	* Fieldbus
	* Backend
	* We'll also discuss another which doesn't fit into either bucket

## Fieldbus vs Backend Protocols
* Commonly found in process and control
* Deployed to connect sensors and actuators to PLCs, and PLCs to supervisory systems such as HMIs
* Backend protocols commonly deployed on or above supervisory networks, and are used to provide efficient system-to-system communication
* We'll dive into 5 common prococols
	* Fieldbus
		* Modicon Communication Bus (Modbus)
		* Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3)
	* Backend
		* Open Process Communications (OPC)
		* Inter-Control Center Protocol (ICCP)
	* Other
		* IEC 61850

## Modbus
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img1.png)
* Invented in 1979 by Modicon to enable PLCs to communicate with real-time computers
* Very widely supported
* Communicates raw messages without authentication or excessive overhead (obviously bad practice by modern standards)
* Application layer protocol (Layer 5 in TCP/IP stack)
* Request-response protocol
	* 3 separate PDUs
		* Modbus request
		* Modbus response
		* Modbus exception response
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img2.png)
* Commands are addressed to specific modbus address.  While other devices may receive the message, only the addressed device will respond.
* Data housed in 4 tables, exact implementation is device-specific

### Variants
* Modbus RTU and Modbus ASCII
	* Support binary and ascii transmissions over serial buses, respectively
* Modbus TCP
	* designed to operate on modern networks
* Modbus Plus
	* designed to extend the reach of modbus for intereconnected buses using token-passing techniques

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img4.png)

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img6.png)
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img7.png)
* Examples of PDUs for the variants.  Many differences, as seen here

### Security Concerns
* Lack of Authentication
	* Only require use of a valid address, function code, and associated data
	* Very simple MITM and Replay vulnerabilities here
* Lack of encryption
	* Modbus addresses sent in the clear
* Lack of message checksum (Modbus/TCP only)
* Lack of broadcast suppression
	* (serial Modbus only used in a multidrop topology)

### Security Recommendations
* Only use between sets of known devices using expected function codes
* Monitor communication with ICS-aware intrusion detection system
* Whitelisting
* Application aware firewall for more critical areas to validate modbus sessions


## Distributed Network Protocol
* Began as a serial protocol much like modbus
* Designed for use between "master stations" or "control stations" and slave devices called "outstations"
* Commonly used to connect RTUs configured as "master stations" to IED "outstations" in electric substations
* Introduced in 1990 by Westronic
* Primary motivation for DNP3 was to provide reliable communications in environments common within the electirc utility industry that include high level of electromagnetic interference (EMI)
	* Much higher degree of reliability than other industrial protocols
	* Accomplished in part with many CRCs
		* CRC is "Cyclic Redundancy Check" [explained here](https://networkencyclopedia.com/cyclic-redundancy-check-crc/)
* DNP3 was extended to work over IP via encapsulation in TCP or UDP packets in 1998
* Now widely used in not only electirc utility, but also oil and gas, water, and wastewater industries
* Reasons for industry migration from Modbus are f[eatures used by other industries such as:
	* report by exception
	* data quality indicators
	* timestamp data
	* 2-pass "select before operate" procedure on outputs
* More reliable than Modbus while remaining efficient and well-suited for real-time uses
* Utilizes several standardized data formats and utilizes timestamps for synchronization of data
* Unlike Modbus and ICCP, DNP3 is bidirectional
	* Therefore possible for a substation to initiate and inform the master station of events outside the norm

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img8.png)
* Sits at application layer of TCP/IP stack.
	* Has its own stack within the application, as shown in image above, corresponding to TCP stack, to offer features at each layer as appropriate

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img9.png)

* Retransmission for CRC failure is ensured with multiple CRC embeddings withing header and payload
* DNP3 supports both static and event data, with classes thereof, for finer-grained and more efficient communication
* Provides a method to identify the remote device's parameters to identify incoming messages and compare them to known point data
	* This is efficient because it only requires the master to interact with relevant/changed data
* Request/response/ack communication pattern, as in other protocols.  Multiple versions thereof
	* Also supports unsolicited responses from outstations and "confirm ack" requests from master station
* Walkthrough of some pcaps of DNP3traffic

### Secure DNP3
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img10.png)
* Standard DNP3 does not provide any security.  Secure DNP3 is a variant that adds authentication to the request/response process
* Challenge occurs on session initiation, potentially after a preset period of time, or on upon a critical request
* Uses a unique session key hashed together from information from both the sender and the challenger
* If using TCP, can also leverage TLS for encryption
* Thus, Secure DNP3 adds authentication, and if using TLS also adds confidentiality
* Often used between master control and an RTU, or between an RTU and different IEDs

### Security Concerns of Regular DNP3
* Lack of authentication
* Lack of inherent encryption
* Fairly easy to manipulate due to well-defined nature of actions in the protocol
* Several vulns have been discovered and reported

## Process Fieldbus (PROFIBUS)
* Originally developed in the late 1980s
* Initially designed primarily to allow PLCs to communicate with host computers
* Several variants exist
	* Profibus PA
		* for instrumentation used for process automation
	* Profisafe
		* for safety applications
	* Profidrive
		* for high-speed drive applications
	* Profibus DP (decentralized periphery)
		* Most widely deployed.  Itself has three variants
		* DP-V0
		* DP-V1
		* DP-V2
		* Each of these is a minor evolutionary step forward
	* Three profiles for Profibus communication
		* asynchronous
		* synchronouse
		* via Ethernet using ethertype 0x8892
			* Profibus over Ethernet is also called PROFINET

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img11.png)
* A master-slave protocol that supports multiple master nodes through the use of  token sharing
* when a master has control of the token it can communicate with its slaves
* each slave is configured to respond to a single master
* slaves can initiate communication to master or to other slaves in the right conditions
* A master node is usually a PLC or RTU and a slave is usually a sensor or motor (or some other similar small component)
* Supports several physical layer deployments
	* Abide by concept of intrinsic safety, meaning power levels too low to ignite fires

### Security Concerns
* PROFIBUS lacks authentication inherent to many of its functions, allowing a spoofed node to impersonate a master node, which in turn provides control over all configured slaves

### Security Recommendations
* PROFIBUS DP is a naturally segmented serial network
* Normally contained within a small geographical area, such as a section of a plant or manufacturing process
* Thus physical security is the main concern

## Industrial Ethernet Protocols
* Industrial Ethernet is the adaptation of the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard to real-time industrial automation applications
* General Ethernet does not provide QoS, so this is needed to allow real-time use
* One primary objective was to move toward more "synchronous" mechanisms of communication to prevent data collisions and minimize jitter inherent with "asynchronous" communications like standard Ethernet
	* Allows technology to be deployed in critical, time-dependent applications
* Also provides physical enhancements to "harden" the office grade nature of standard Ethernet
	* ruggedized wiring, connectors, and hardware 

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img12.png)
* There are 30 different varieties of Industrial Ethernet.  We will discuss 5 (bolded above.

### Profinet
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img13.png)
* Designed for scalability.  Can be deployed across varying network conditions.  Each version improved reliability and cycle time speed.
* Security concerns
	* Profinet is a real-time ethernet procotol, and as such is susceptible to any of the vulnerabilities of Ethernet
	* Lack of authentication and inherent protocol vulnerability common to industrial protocols exacerbated by increased risk because this can be transmitted across standard enterprise and public networks (Ethernet is everywhere)
	* Thus, Profinet TCP/IP should be tightly controlled.  Within less-trusted business networks, used only over authenticated and encrypted networks 

### Ethercat
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img14.png)
* Real-time Ethernet-based fieldbus protocol classified as "Industrial Ethernet"
* Messages can either be transmitted directly as an Ethernet frame, or encapsulated as a UDP payload
* Communicates large amounts of distributed process data with a single Ethernet frame 
	* This is good for efficiency because it means few cycles to communicate entire corpus of data
* Security concerns
	* As expected, susceptible to all vulnerabilities of standard Ethernet 
	* EtherCAT is sensitive and highly susceptible to DOS attacks
* Security Recommendations
	* secure perimiter
	* passive network monitoring with whitelisting of devices
	* ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS

### Ethernet Powerlink
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img15.png)
* Directly encapsulates ethernet frames
* Cyclic polling of slave devices by a master node
* Multiple phases
	* Start of Control
	* Isochronous phase
		* Slaves respond only if they receive a poll, preserving sequencing
	* Asynchronous phase
		* allows larger, non-time-critical data to be transmitted
	* Process repeats 
* Security concerns
	* As expected, susceptible to all vulnerabilities of standard Ethernet 
	*  Ethernet Powerlink is sensitive and highly susceptible to DOS attacks
	*  Easily disrupted via the insertion of rogue Ethernet frames into the network, requiring the separation of Powerlink from other Ethernet systems
* Security Recommendations
	* Require a clear demarcation from other networks, needed by protocol anyway.  Thus establish appropriate zones
	* ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS

 ### SERCOS III (Serial Real-Time Communication System)
 * For communication between industrial controls, motion devices, and IO devices
 * V1 and V2 were based on fiber optic ring, v3 is Ethernet-based
 * Works directly on ethernet frames
 * Supports many straight and rign topologies
 * Master-slave protocol operating cyclically in which a single master synch telegram is used to communicate with slaves.
	 * Slaves are given a specific time in which they can place their information on the bus

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img16.png)
 * All messages for all nodes are packaged into a master data telegram (MDT)
	 * Each node knows which portion of the MDT it should read based on a pre-determined byte allocation
 * Allocation Telegram (AT) is issued by master but populated by each slave with their appropriate response data.
	 * Multiple slaves share same AT
 * Unified Communication (UC) phase the SERCOS network is open to allow ethernet frames or TCP/UDP traffic from other such devices
* Security concerns
	* As expected, susceptible to all vulnerabilities of standard Ethernet 
	*  SERCOS III is sensitive and highly susceptible to DOS attacks
	*  Through the UC Channel, also shares all vulnerabilities of enabled protocols, and can be used to attack other networks such as enterprise or industrial
* Security Recommendations
	* Network isolation is critical
	* SERCOS III should only be used on control loops that definitively require it
	* IP Channels (UC Channel phase) should be restricted, or avoided if at all possible
		* If used, the IP channels should be enclosed within zones consisting of SERCOS III master node and only required IP devices
	* ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS

## Backend Protocols
### Open Process Communication
* OPC is not actually an industrial protocol, but instead a series of standards specifications 
* Designed to provied a higher level of integration between systems and subsystems than a fieldbus protocol
* Motivated by needs of end users, as opposed to vendors, for interacting with different industrial devices
* OPC's strengths and weaknesses come from its foundation
	* Microsoft OLE is a big foundation
	* Allows for data presentation to be separate from the application that generated it

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img17.png)
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img18.png)
* Client-server functional pattern.
* Client calls to server, process executes on server
	* Uses RPC for calls
* Used in industrial networks, across many different use cases, to greatly simplify integration across devices
* Security Concerns
	* OPC's use of DCOM and RPC makes it highly vulnerable to attack using multiple vectors
		* Shared attack surface with OLE, which is a very popular target
	* OPC hosted on unsupported OS's adds additional risk
	* Many basic host security concerns apply because OPC is supported on Windows
	* OPC host account on OS presents a big risk if overpriviliged, especially as it will be shared across hosts
	* Basically, this is a modern tool on a (relatively) modern platform, so it's a casualty of all the other threats targeting that platform
* Security Recommendations
	* The newer and designed for security Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) specifications should be used where possible
	* Use best practices, as applied to any other windows box

### Inter-control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP)
* Designed for communication between control centers within the electric utility industry
* Classified as a backend protocol because it was designed for bidirectional, WAN communication between control centers
* A standardized, common protocol was needed for communication between these disparate control centers which often do different functions and have different owners.  
* Uses a master(client)-slave(server) model, with request/response pattern
	* Primarily unidirectional, but modern implementations often allow hosts to function as both client and server creating a pseudo-bidirectional pattern
* Operates over almost any network protocol, but commonly uses ISO transport
* Effectively a point-to-point protocol due to use of bilateral table acting as an ACL for each control center
* Security Concerns
	* ICCP lacks authentication and encryption and is therefore susceptible to any number of attacks (spoofing, session hijacking, etc)
		* There is a Secure ICCP variant that incorporates digital certificate auth and crypt, but it is not widely used.  It should be
	* Explicitly defined trust relationships can be exploited
		* e.g. if bilateral tables get compromised, the jig is entirely up
	* Too accessible, as a WAN protocol.  Lots of attack surface on WAN (e.g. WAN)
* Security Recommendations
	* Secure ICCP variants should be used wherever possible and supported by the current vendors installed within a particular site
	* Patch and update, there are lots of known vulns for ICCP so leaving old versions up running across WAN is just asking for it.
	* Extreme care should be taken in the definition of the bilateral table.  It's the firewall, any mistakes here are a big problem
	* Standard modern best practices.
	* ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS

## IEC 61850 Standard
* Doesn't cleanly fit into either Fieldbus or Backend categories
* International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 61850 was originally conceived for substation automation
* The design concepts are being incorporated throughout the generation, transmission, and distribution areas of the power industry and may even see adoption in the consumer/load component
	* Extended to domains beyond isolated substation automation
	* We will discuss in its original context, but these concepts are applicable wherever the standard is
* For almost 20 years, comms were done using coper wires and legacy protocols described above.
	* This generally sucked, for a variety of reasons
	* Ethernet has helped with some of this, but a broader solution was needed.
	* Enter 61850
* First version of 61850 was released in 2005 with several broad goals
	* Single complete standard for the equipment and related data in a substation:
		* configuring
		* monitoring
		* reporting
		* storing
		* communicating
* Aimed to permit interoperability of equipment afrom different manufacturers.
	* Further, common format for this equipment's data and configs
* Has a data and communications model
* Designed to run on top of a standard Ethernet LAN
	* Can be either coper or fiber, but fiber is preferred for multiple reasons

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img19.png)
* Defines two communication buses
	* Process bus
		* sends power systems information from CV/VT/Transducers to HMIs or PLCs or IEDs
		* very sensitive to delay, so very high throughput
		* Often has redundant components to ensure high availability
	* Station bus
		* connects all the IEDs to each other and to a router for external communication
		* used for less sensitive data compared to process bus, but still built for HA

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img20.png)
* Communications protocols can be classified into 3 different groups
	* machine to machine
		* based on generic substation event (GSE)
			* a peer to peer layer 2 protocol that multicasts events to multiple devics, typically IED to IEDs
				* Further divided into:
					* Generic Substation State Events (GSSE)
						* Seldom used
						* Only state events
					* Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE)
						* Most common
						* Any event.  In practice, all events.
	* client server
	* configuration protocols
* The 61850 standard does not include security specifications of its own
	* defers to IEC 62351-6
	* IEC 62351 provides security specifications for substation communications and is broken down into several parts
		* 62351-3 requries TLS for all TCP/IP based communications, as well as node and message authentication	
	* Encryption is not supported because it would be impossible to maintain GOOSE's 4ms performance requirement, so VLANs are used for protection
		* This is not really secure.  VLAN ID spoofing would allow an attacker to hop between VLANs, bypassing these Layer 3 controls 

## Advanced Metering Infrastructure and the Smart Grid
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img21.png)
* The attack surface here is huge, and once compromised lots of traversal is possible
* AMI has lots of features that are very promising, remote everything basically
* Smart grid has introduced new protocols in the "Home Area Network" or HAN space

### Security Concerns
* AMI
	* it's an extremely large network that touches many other networks.  lots of attack surface
* The security concerns of the smart grid are numerous
* Smart grid protocols vary widely in their inherent security and vulnerabilities
* Smart meters are readily accessible, and therefore require board-level and chip-level protections
* Neighborhood, home, and business LANs can be used as ingress to the AMI and as a target from the AMI
* Smart grids are ultimately interconnected with critical power generation, transmission, and distribution systems
* Smart grids represent a very juicy target to a variety of threat actors

### Security Recommendations
* Risk and threat analysis before smart grid deployments, in their planning stages
	* similarly, assessment of the end users who will be connected to the grid, as they represent an attack vector
* Clear delineation, separation of services, and the establishment of strong defense-in-depth at the perimeters
