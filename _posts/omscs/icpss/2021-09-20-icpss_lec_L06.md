# Intro To Industrial Control Systems & Operations

## System Assets
* Sensors
* Actuators
* Gauges
* Motor Drives
* Indicators
* PLCs
* RTUs
* IEDs
* HMIs

### PLCs

* Programmable Logic Controller
* A specialized industrial computer used for automation
* Unlike desktop computers, PLCs are typically physically hardened and may be specialized for specific industrial uses with multiple specailized inputs and outputs
	* They do not usually have an OS.  They usually rely on specific application programs that allow the PLC to function automatically, generating output actions
	* They typically control real-time processes

#### PLC Operation
* Works by continuously scanning a program in a loop
	1. Check input status
	1. Execute program
		* may be conditioned on inputs
	3. Update output status 

#### PLC Ladder Logic
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L06_img3.png)
* PLC's can use ladder logic, which is a simplistic programming language built into them (included in the relevant standard)
* LL gets its name from the legacy method of implementing discrete logic from electromechanical relays
* Can be thought of a series of connections between relay inputs (inputs) and relay coils (outputs)
	* If output is reached, coil is energized
* Switched can be used to compare a continuous digital input to a binary physical input (comparing to setpoints)

* logic can be more complex, see here an "or" condition

#### Other languages
* Standard includes ladder logic as mentioned above.
* Also includes:
	* Structured Text (ST)
	* Function Block Diagram (FBD)
	* Instruction Lists (IL)
	* Sequential Function Charts (SFC)

### Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)
* Often reside in substation or otherwise remote location
* Monitor field parameters, and transmit back to monitoring station
* Usually include some way to beacon out, such as modem or radio
	* Very limited bandwidth
	* Thus, usually use minimalistic protocols such as "report by acception"
* Can be powered via solar or electric
* Often in extreme environmental conditions
* Modern RTUs overlap largely with PLCs, as tech advances

### Intelligent Electronic Device (IED)
* Each industry has unique requirements, so equipment will vary from one to the next
* IEDs are used as bridge between analog and digital domains, used widely in power grids
* As with all tech, growing more sophisticated over time
	* For this class, we can assume the IED supports a specific function within the overall control system, as opposed to RTU or PLC which are meant to be flexible enough for general use

### Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L06_img5.png)
* Replace manual switches and dials with digital equivalents
* Much easier to adapt and adjust
* Can be run on either commodity hardware, or on industrial hardened machines with a touch panel
* Usually runs on Windows Embedded
* Allows "single pane of glass" control over complex processes
* Interesting note, usually no authentication to avoid password lockouts in emergencies
* Security is usually done at local workstation by restricting application execution, and also leans on physical security

### Supervisory Workstations
* Read-only, strictly for monitoring use
	* Can, however change parameters such as alarm limits or process setpoints
* HMI system or dashboard/workbook from data historian

### Data Historian
* specialized software system that collects point values, alarm events, batch records, and other information from industrial devices or systems, and stores them in a purpose-built database
* There are some third-party vendors, but often these come from first party ICS vendors
* Data points referred to as 'tags' and can generally refer to anything
* Data often replicated across business and industrial networks
	* This is a huge security concern, so historians must be hardened, and strict access controls put in place

### Business Information Console
* Extensions of supervisory workstations
* Designed to deliver business intelligence to upper management
* Consist of same data obtained from HMI or data historian systems
* May be a physical console, or a historian with an ICS DMZ located elsewhere

### Other Assets
* Printers
* Badge readers
* IP Telephones
* IP Cameras
* AD
* Time servers
* All of the above present attack surface and must be assessed

## Control Loop
1. Read data from sensors
1. Execute logic against the data
1. Write data to automation devices
1. Go to 1

### Closed vs Open Loops
* In closed loops, output of one iteration affects input of the next, while in open loop it does not
* Slides talk through example of ladder logic for cycling level in a water tank
* Slides talk through several examples around more complex control loops

## Production Information Management
* All such processes and loops above must be managed from a central location, usually a data historian
* "Historizing" the data is the process of capturing and organizing the myriad data the control system generates
* From the historian, analytics are generated and used to inform the management of the system
	* can be used to spot trend and anomalies, and optimize the process

## Business Information Management
* Used to optimize for business KPIs
* Operational data in business network
	* This reduces the strength of the security perimiter
* Each data access mechanism has security challenges
* Appropriate security mechanisms must be put in place

## Process Management
* Driven by HMI
* HMI can be used to monitor output and adjust inputs or process setpoints
* HMI translates system functions to human-readable controls
	* e.g. write single coil -> turn on water pump
* This means that compromising an HMI is a huge risk, as they functionally run the system
	* e.g. Stuxnet
	* However, attacker must have specific knowledge of the process in question to know which changes would actually have an impact
		* This makes casual attacks harder, but is not a defense against targeted attacks

## Safety-Instrumented Systems (SIS)
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L06_img6.png)
* Part of a layered stack of protections
* Helps as an automated safeguard before things become "incidents"
* If compromised, this safety is removed.
	* Key part of a DoS attack

## The Smart Grid
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L06_img7.png)
* An amalgamation of many industrial networks
* Built using the assets, processes, and controls discussed so far
* Because it's such an amalgamation, attack surface is huge
