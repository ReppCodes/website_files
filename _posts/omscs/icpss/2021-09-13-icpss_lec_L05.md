# Industrial Cyber Security History and Threats
* Compared to traditional IT systems, CPS's are:
	* more specialized
	* greater demands on reliability and longevity
	* high-stakes systems

## Need to improve
* The need to improve cannot be overstated
* Physical security on many CPS's are decent, but digital is not great
	* Physical is often helped by being geographically remote
	* Given that physical is decent, digital usually represents the only feasible way in
* Historically CPS networks were air-gapped, leaving infosec as something that didn't need to be thought about
	* in modern times, this airgap almost never actually exists, for cost and convenience reasons

## What is the state of security posture for CPS's
* A massive pentest found tens of thousands of vulns
*  Also provided metadata around responses
	* average time to patch found was 331 days, with a long right tail
	* industry standard disclosure practice is to disclose upon patch release, giving a window between patch release and patch application for badness to happen
	* This is not (necessarily) due to negligence.  Control systems are hard to patch due to things like topology, downtime requirements, and such.
		* A common response to this is to focus on strengthening the perimeter defenses in lieu of patching

## Summary of Past Incident Reports
* Most attacks seem to be opportunistic 
	* This may change going forwards
* Initial attacks tend to use simpler exploits
	* This may just be because nothing more complex was needed, not because nothing better exists
* The majority of cyber-attracks are financially motivated
	* Again, may change going forwards
* New malware samples are increasing at an alarming rate
* The majority of attacks originate externally
* However, the majority of incidents affecting industrial systems are unintentional
* New malware code samples are increasingly more sophisticated
* Malware and "hacking as a service" is increasingly available

## APTs and Weaponized Malware
* APT Qualities
	* Not intended to impact or disrupt network operations
	* Designed to avoid detection over long periods of time
* Weaponized Malware Qualities
	* Possible intentions include network disruption
	* Possible intentions include physical damage of systems or devices

## High Profile Cases
* Night Dragon
	* A series of attacks over a 2 year period targeting oil and energy companies, stealing sensitive information
* Stuxnet
	* A worm developed to infect as many computers as possible.
	* When it found Iranian centrifugrs, it activated and ruined them

## The future of malware
* Sophistication will continue to increase over time
* It's expensive to develop things from scratch, so it's reasonable to expect that the majority will be evolutions on existing tools and techniques, instead of from-scratch new builds

## Insider Threats
* One of the most common pitfalls is to roll out security policies without building an appropriate threat model.  This results in policies targeting the wrong things.
* The most probable threat is an insider.  
	* Employees with direct access to data
	* Employees with admin privileges
	* Employees with indirect access to data
	* Subcontractor with access to specific ICS componensts or subsystems for operation
	* Services providers with access to specific ICS components or subsystems for support

## Recent history
* Disclosures spiked around 2010
	* The year Stuxnet was discovered
* This is likely due to:
	*  a combination of increased awareness around ICS
	*  increased hacktivism in cultural contexts
	*  improved availability of Open Source Tools for conducting attacks
