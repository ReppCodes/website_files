# Hacking Industrial Control Systems
## Motives and Consequences
* Industrial networks are responsible for continuous and batch processing and other manufacturing operations of almost every scale
* Consequences can range from benign disruptions to deliberate sabotage
* List of potential impacts is almost innumerable
	* Local impacts include:
		* impact to quality and business reputation
		* loss of produciton
		* loss of intellectual property
		* penalties for regulatory noncompliance
	* Regional impacts include:
		* economic (micro) impact
		* mechanical stress/failure
		* catastrophic equipment failure
		* localized loss of life
	* Global impacts include:
		* generalized panic
		* economic (macro) impact
		* widespread loss of life
* A SIS may ensure safety, but it shares too much attack surface with the rest of the Industrial network, and do not ensure security.
	* Simple MITM can beat them
	* Quote to remember "do not assume that safety leads to security, or security leads to safety"
* Compliance also doesn't necessarily lead to security

## Common Targets
* Each system is unique in composition, but share many components.  Detailed knowledge helps the attacker, but there's enough shared surface to do damage
* For example, a very common target is SCADA servers
	* Attack vector could be a control network
	* Attack method could be exploitation of trusted connections within control network
	* Can result in plant shutdown

## Common Attack Methods
* Similar to above, some methods are evergreen when hitting ICS
* Man In the Middle (MITM)
* Denial of Service (DoS)
	* when some malicious event attempts to make a resource unavailable
	* Can be very impactful
* Replay Attacks
	* attacker will eavesdrop on a channel, and can replay traffic which may contain data, commands, or login information
	* requires an indepth knowledge of ICS operations to fully exploit, but even a naive attacker can do damage or get lucky
* The reasons these are common are:
	* insecure communicatio nrpotocols
	* little device-to-device authentication
	* delicate communication stacks in embedded devices
* The vectors used to compomise an Engineering Workstation (EWS) are not much different than those used previously with the HMI
	* Typically a single hose with strong permissions
	* Can configure access control mechanisms
	* Can update the primary control equipment
	* May contain sensitive documentation
* Blended attacks
	* More sophisticated attacks will combine elements of multiple types of malware, and employ multiple attack vectors to increase the potency and threat of the attack

## Examples of Weaponzed Industrial Cyber Threats
* First documented ICS cyber-attack "in the wild" was Stuxnet
* Cyber-attacks against industrial networks were, at one time, purely theoretical
	* obviously, no longer true
* There have been several high-profile attacks since Stuxnet
	* Shamoon (DistTrack)
		* publicized due to its highly destructive nature.  no precision, just wiped everything it could spread to
	* Flame (Flamer or Skywiper)
		* showed signs of being a derivative of Stuxnet, but with the goal of espionage instead of sabotage

## Stuxnet
* Stuxnet is still the "gold standard", poster child of ICS malware
	* was very precise, sabotaging specific ICS devices 
* Early versions of Stuxnet were released as early as November 2007
* First real example of weaponzed computer malware
* Extremely complex and intelligent collection of malware
* Armed with 4 0-days, targeting windows machines
* Compromised systems with specific softawre and specific PLCs
* Deployed 7 different propagation methods
	* for those using removable media, would remove itself after the media infected 3 new hosts

### Dissecting Stuxnet
* It is the first rootkit targeting ICS
* It can self-update even when cut off from the C2 servers
	* by enumerating and remembering a p2p network
* Can inject code into PLCs, and also hide itself within PLCs
* Adapts to its environment
* Uses system-level hardcoded creds
* Install malicious Windows drivers, using compromised certs
* Complete details still unknown

### Lessons Learned from Stuxnet
* Previous belief: control systems can be effectively isolated from other networks
	* Lesson learned: a strong perimeter defence can be bypassed by a curious operator
* Previous belief: PLCs and RTUs lack the necessary attack surface to make them vulnerable
	* Lesson learned: PLCs can and have been targeted and infected by malware
* Previous belief: highly specialized devices benefit from "security through obscurity"
	* Lesson learned: A highly specalized attack against an industrial control system can occur
* Previous belief: firewalls and IDS/IPS are sufficient to protect a control system network from attack
	* Lesson learned: Zero-day vulnerabilities obviate the efficacy of traditional security

## Industrial Application Layer Attacks
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L11_img1.png)
* Do not always require that a specific vulnerability be exploited, because these applications are designed to have large degrees of control by default.  This is in contrast to consumer systems, where applications generally have limited permissions
	* In the above example image, attacks can be launched simply by issuing modbus commands.  No escalation or control flow hijack necessary.

## Cannibalistic Mutant Underground Malware
### Malware with a mind!
* Conditional logic to direct activity based on its surroundings
* Update itself in the wild
* Self-destruction of certain code blocks
* self-updates of others
	* Stuxnet did this with p2p communication.  When a machine with an older version of Stuxnet bumped into a machine with a newer version, it took the update and updated itself
	* Malware morphs to avoid detection
* Can also check for presence of other known malware and adjust itself if others are found to help avoid detection
* Stuxnet showed how this can be built, but with a very narrow goal
* The next one may be less specifically targeted

### Dealing with an Infection
* Upon detecting an infection, you may not want to immediately clean the system of infected malware
* There may be subsequent levels of infection that exist, yet are dormant and may be activated as a result
* There could also be valuable information
* First step is to logically isolate the infected host so that it can no longer cause any harm
* Allow malware to communicate over C2 channels with host isolated, to learn
* Collect as much forensic detail as possible (system logs, network traffic,  memory analysis data)
* Approach the situation with dilligence and perform a thorough investigation
* A bare metal reload may be necessary where a device is completely erased
	* even this may not be enough, UEFI or other such compromise may be unrecoverable

## Smart Grid Specific Attacks
* Starting with reconnaisance and then scanning, the architecture of the grid can begin to be mapped
* Once a target system is identified enumeration, penetration, and infection occur
* Once breached, the attacker can continue to enumerate and prapagate

### Motive
* Smart grid attacks are most easily classified by their intent, because of the smart grid's diversity and complexity
* Most common motives fora cyber attack against a grid infrastructure:
	* theft of information for profit or reconaissance
	* denial of service
* By looking at attacks by motive rather than attack processes, a broader risk assessment can be determined
* Remediation occurs at a higher level

### Theft of Information
* A lot of valuable information in smart grid
* Personal information about smart grid customers
	* finance and billing
* Information about energy consumption
* SCADA and automation systems within the grid also provide a blueprint to the inner workings of the grid operations

### Denial of Service
* ICS within smart grid are not  (supposed to be) publicly accessible
	* Thus, traditional DoS by just flooding packets at a public endpoint are not applicable here
* However, they are also not usually "modern" systems
	* Usually running outdated and unpatched operating systems
* Often have low-bandwidth networks
* Running real-time, very fragile industrial protocols
* Thus, actually more susceptible to a Denial of Service attack

### Manipulation of Service
* Goal of a manipulation of service attack is to preserve the availability of a service while affecting or altering its operation
* Examples:
	* spoofing GPS time synchronization to de-synchronize distribution phasor readings
	* Stuxnet attack, which penetrated and altered the specific control instructions
* The manipulation of some data sources could be catastrophic
	* example: by manipulating the low-voltage and high-voltage sides of a transformer an attacker can physically destroy it 

## Common Industrial Targets
* Example 1: Manipulate feeder measurements to target yard protection, impacting yard safety
* Example 2: Manipulate current load measurement to target energy management system, impacting load management systems
* Other examples given
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L11_img2.png)
* The interconnectedness of the smart grid allows attacks to propaagate, making most systems viable targets
* The large scale distribution of systems makes it challenging to effectively segment these systems
* While common attack methodologies apply to the smart grid, the attack surface is much larger
* When application-layer protcols are used over TCP/IP, additional vulnerabilities occur

## Vulnerability
* After enumeration, various attack methodologies can be used, often exploiting vulnerabilities
* Some of these vulnerabilities are specific to a device and require effort to identify and exploit
* Some are "vulnerabilities" that are inherent within the protocols usedby these legacy systems
* Many smart grid devices possess vulnerabilities that can be determined through analysis and reverse engineering of that device
	* Utilizing a variety of open source development and debugging tools
	* Looking for weaknesses such as heap or stack overflows
	* Many white hat tools and agencies exist to facilitate this process
* Reverse engineering device code is effective but resource-intensive
* There are many well-known, fully disclosed ICDS vulnerabilities that haven't been patched
* Many of these vulnerabilities have been exploited either in a proof of concept environment or through the development of actual exploit code
* 2016 report from Kaspersky found that:
	*  188,8019 hosts with ICS components available via the Internet
	*  92%(172,982) remotely available ICS hosts have vulnerabilities
	*  The number of vulnerabilities in ICS components has increased tenfold during the past five years

### Turning a Vulnerability into a Compromise
* When a vulnerability is identified it can be used to build a targeted exploit
* Information about thevulnerability can allow an attacker to craft an attack to compromise the target system
* This process is illustrated in detail by [SCADA Hacker](scadahacker.com)

## Attack Tools
* There are many tools available used to secure or hack networks
* Most are well-known, gneeral-purpose cybersecurity tools, although recently some Smart Grid specific tools have also been developed
* Many of the tools and frameworks are available as open-source

* InGuardians "OptiGuard"
* Two tools available to hack smart meters through optical interfaces

## CPS Sensory Channel Attacks
* Reminder of closed-loop feedback setup
* Recall, sensors serve as input for CPS's
* Depending on the type of sensor, the data rate can be very low
* Theorized that sensors can also be used like network interfaces, possibly to transfer malware
* There has been work that sought to explore such attacks
* The work focuses on different sensory channels
	* Visible light
	* Infrared
	* Acoustic
	* Seismic
* The model here is that we assume the system has flawed code, and we attempt to determine the technical feasibility of such attacks, and to illustrate examples

### Visible Light Channel
* Widely used sensory channel
* Utilized in various applications including:
	* Automatic brightness control for LCDs
	* Light detection and ranging (LIDAR)
* In some recent studies, they are utilized as side channels to transfer sensitive data

### Infrared Channel
* A number of remote controller systems utilize the infrared channel
* iRobot Create and Turtle bot use it for:
	* Navigation assistance
	* Obstacle avoidance
* Microsoft Kinect uses IR beams:
	* To create a 3d map of the room
	* For user interaction
* Since it is not visible, it can support covert channels

### Acoustic Channel
* Used by many robotic systems and military applications
	* Obstacle avoidance
	* Map buildings
* Primary method: emit a short burst osund wave and measure its physical characteristics (e.g., speed, amplitude) from reflection from obstacles via transducers
* Relatively easy to recognize different vehiclse, aircraft, missiles based on their sonic signatures  

### Seismic Channel
* Popular in smartphones and tablets to enhance the user experience
	* Accelerometers are used for presenting landscape or portrait views
		* Used for remote controllers for game consoles, e.g. Wii
		* Also used for authentication, e.g. Bump app for file sharing

### Evaluation of Sensory Channel Threats to CPS
* Sensory channels can be used in three different ways 
	*  To trigger an existing malware on the host CPS device
	*  To transfer malware through the channel itself
	*  Combined with other sensory channels as well as traditional channels (e.g RF)
* How fast can we trigger?
	* Using various embedded platforms, the transfer rate was determined empirically to see if there could be support to trigger existing dormant malware
	* Study 1:
		* Platform: Telosb
		* Channel: Light
		* Observed Rate (bps): 85-100
	* Study 2:
		* Platform: MicaZ (MTS400CC)
		* Channel: Light
		* Observed Rate (bps): 2-3
	* Study 3:
		* Platform: MicaZ (MTS310CB)
		* Channel: Light
			* Observed Rate (bps): 50-65
		* Channel: Acoustic
			* Observed Rate (bps): 2-3
		* Channel: Seismic
			* Observed Rate (bps): 50-65
	* Study 4:
		* Platform: iRobot Create
		* Channel: Infrared
		* Observed Rate (bps): 30-45

### Exploiting Visible Light Channel
* Testbed:
	* implemented a sample Morse code encoder app on HTC Inspire Smartphone with Android 2.3.5
	* implemented a Morse code decoder on the mote
	* MTS310CB sensor board
* Purpose: secret trigger/malware transfer
	* Successfully transferred the word "MALWARE"

### Exploiting Acoustic Channel
* Testbed:
	* MicaZ sensors (buzzer and receiver)
	* MTS310BC sensor board
	* implemented Morse coder/decoder applications on motes
* Purpose: secret trigger/malware transfer
	* Successfully transferred the word "ATTACK"

### Exploiting Seismic Channel
* Testbed:
	* Implemented an incoming call app via vibration on HTC Inspire Smartphone with Android 2.3.5
	* Implemented a simple program on the mote for receiving the trigger
	* Accelerometer (ADXL 202JE) on MTS310CB sensor board used 
* Purpose: secret trigger / malware transfer with the vibrations

### Exploiting Infrared Channel
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L11_img3.png)
* Attack: Unauthorized control of an access-restricted program module
* Exploited simplevulnerable services in iRobot Create via its infrared channel
* Created custom malware for iRobot
* Goal: gain internal access to a protected program via infrared channel

## Is Conventional Security the Solution?
* No
* Current security solutions are limited to protecting the CPS components networked via traditional means (e.g. RF)
* Similarly, security services on the host CPS devices are not suitable for sensory channel threats
* One effective way for defense is to use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS's)
	* Analyze the sensor traffic looking at data via signature-based or anomaly-based detection methods
* Given sensory channels are novel attack surface:
	* There is no current signature for CPS devices
	* Anomalies not defined yet for CPS realm
* For sensory channels, physical conditions of the medium, values, characteristics of the received sensory data need to be understood well
