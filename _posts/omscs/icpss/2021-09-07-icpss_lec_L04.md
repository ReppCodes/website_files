# Industrial Networks
* Automation systems that provide control and monitoring to CPSs
	* Process control systems
	* Distributed control systems
	* Supervisory control and Data Acquisition systems
		* SCADA!

### Simplified Representation of Industrial Network

### Within wider context of actual network

## Protocols
* Often use non  standard protocols, such as Modbus
* Often designed for serial use, have been adjusted to work at varying levels of OSI model
* Because they were not designed to be publicly exposed, often they are fundamentally insecure
* Security by obscurity is no longer sufficient

## Routability
* Distinction between routable and non-routable networks is diminishing as IP slowly eats everything
* Routable typically means "uses IP", while non-routable may use serial, bus, or point-to-point communication

* Legacy protocols such as modbus have also been updated to work over IP
* At this point it's safest to assume all networks are connected to routable networks, one way or another
	* This is further exacerbated by remote-access functionality on otherwise non-routable devices

### Zones and Enclaves

* To ensure protection, network segmentation must be done
* Does not necessarily require physical boundary, but logical delineation at least must be done
* Perimiter is the outmost bound of assets, and is a natural point to place controls
* Cloud architectures make defining a perimiter a bit more complicated

## Critical Infrastructure
* Industrial Network == any network operating some sort of automated control system that communicates digitally over a network
* Critical Infrastructure == the critical systemss and assets used within a networked computing infrastructure
	* 16 sectors recognized by the US as critical infrastructure
		* PPD-21
		* banking and finance, chemical, IT, manufacturing, defense, food and Agriculture, commercial, comms, dams, emergency services, energy, govt facilities, healthcare, nuclear, transportation, water
		* Shoutout to NERC CIP regulating the power grid

* Lectures chat through some of the above list, and discuss some nuance.  No real meat there, not transcribed

## Common Industrial Security Recommendations
1. Identifying what systems need to be protected
	* Asset inventory, and assess importance thereof
	* Tells us what should be monitored and how closely
	* Informs network segmentation and placement of security points such as firewalls
2. Separating the systems logically into functional groups
	* reduces attack surface, easiest step to do so
	* firewall rules get a lot easier if you're only protecting one kind of thing, fewer permit rules needed
	* functional DMZ's
3. Implementing a defense-in-depth strategy around each system or group
4. Controlling access into and between each group
5. Monitoring activities that occur within and between groups
6. Limiting the actions that can bew executed within and between groups

* Note the firewall icons can be any number of security things, such as ACLs, firewalls, application filters, etc

* Defense in depth, the diagram.  This is good.

### Additional Security Recommendations
* Real-time security monitoring
* Application whitelisting
* Policy whitelisting
