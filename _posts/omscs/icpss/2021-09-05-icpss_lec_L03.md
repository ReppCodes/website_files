# Networking
* Computer network connects two or more computing devices of the same or differing types

## Types of networks
* Types of networks are categorized by the geographic area they cover
* BAN - body area network -- local to a human body
* LAN - local area network -- about building sized
* MAN - metropolitan area network -- about city-sized, often falls between LAN and WAN and not a common term
* WAN - wide area network - global or regional, such as the internet

## Network Topology
* The way in which devices are connected to a network
* Layout and paths
* Common topologies include:
	* Bus topology
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img1.png)
	* Ring topology
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img2.png)
	* Star topology
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img3.png)
	* Extended star topology
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img4.png)
		* central nodes are backbone switches, directing traffic where it is needed
	* Mesh topology
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img5.png)
		* used primarily for redundancy and fault tolerance
		* also often used for wireless networks due to the nature of wireless as a medium

## OSI Model
* Open Systems Interconnection

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img6.png)
* Multiple protocols at each layer
* Owned by ISO (International Standards Organization)
* Each Layer serves a separate role

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img7.png)

* Within a computer each layer uses the services of the layer below it
* Across computers, each layer communicates with the equivalent layer on the other machine
	* It does this by traversing down the layer stack, and back up in the other machine
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img8.png)
	* Differentiates between end-to-tend layer and hop-by-hop layers, indicated in this diagram
* As information traverses down the stack, a header is added by each layer, and is stripped as it traverses back up.

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite
* developed before the OSI model, is similar but doesn't quite line up
* Is generally more appropriate/accurate to actual protocol usage
* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img10.png)
* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img11.png)

* Addresses the Syn/SynAck/Ack three-way handshake
	* Also mentions the Fin Active close equivalent
* Discusses some control flow stuff in TCP


# Security
* CPS security goals are the same as traditional IT security, just harder to accomplish and higher stakes
* The security of a system/application/protocol is relative to:
	* a set of desired properties
	* an adversary with specific capabilities
* Goals are:
	* Confidentiality
	* Integrity
	* Availability

## Confidentiality
### Tools for Confidentiality
* Encryption -- transform information using a secret
* Access control -- use rules and policies to limit access to information
	* Authentication -- determine identity of a role for someone requesting access
		* Use something someone knows, has, or is
	* Authorization -- the determination if a person or system is allowed to access a resource, using a policy
	* Physical security -- the establishment of physical barriers to limit access to protected computational resources

## Integrity
* The property that information has not been altered in an unauthorized way

## Availability
* The propety that information is accessible and modifiable in a timely fashion by those authorized to do so

## Other Security Concepts
### Assurance
* Refers to how trust is provided and managed in computer systems
* Policies specify behavioral expetations that people or systems have for themselves or others
* Permissions describe the behaviors that are allowed by the agents that interact with a person or system
* Protections describe mechanisms put in place to enforce permissions and policies

### Authenticity
* The ability to determine that statements, policies, and permissions issued by persons or systems are genuine
* Digital signatures use cryptographic computations that allow a person or system to commit to the authenticity of their documents in a unique way that achieves nonrepudiation

### Anonymity
* The property that certain records or transactions cannot be attributed to any individual
* Aggregation iss the combining of data from many individuals so that disclosed sums or averages cannot be tied to any individual
* Mixing is the intertwining of transactions, information, or communmications in a way that cannot be traced to any individual
* Proxies are trusted agents that are willing to engage in actions for an individual in a way that cannot be traced back to that person
* Psuedonyms are fictional identities that can fill in for real identities in communications and transactions, but are otherwise known only to a trusted entity 

## Threats and Attacks
### Eavesdropping
* The interception of information inteded for someone else during its transmission over a communication channel 
* Attack on confidentiality

### Alteration
* The unauthorized modification of information
* Attack on integrity

### Denial of Service
* The interruption or degradation of a data service or information access 
* Attack on availability

### Masquerading
* The fabrication of information that is purported to be from someone who is not actually the author
* Attack on authenticity

### Repudiation
* The denial of a commitment or data receipt
* Attack on authenticity

### Correlation and Traceback
* The integration of multiple data sources and information flows to determine the source of a particular data stream or piece of information 
* Attacks on anonymity

## Ten Security Principles
* Economy of mechanism
	* complexity is the enemy of security.  keep it simple
* Fail-safe defaults
	* the default configuration should have a conservative protection scheme
	* e.g. minimal access rights keeps user-level damage low
* Complete mediation
	* every access to a resource must be checked for compliance
	* things like caching permissions are *scary*
* Open design
	* security should be publicly available for better scrutiny of security
	* only secrets should be secret
* Separation of privilege
	* multiple conditions should be required to get at protected things
* Least privilege
	* what it says on the tin.  compromise is kept cheaper if your lost password only gets at your stuff
* Least common mechanism
	* if multiple users share a computer they should have separate accounts
	* avoid sharing stuff wherever possible
* Psychological acceptability
	* if security makes no sense or is hard or jarring, people will avoid using it
* Work factor
	* keep in mind your threat model, scope security measures appropriately to avoid wasting resources you might need elsewhere
* Compromise recording
	* sometimes it is more desirable to record details of an intrustion
	* e.g., affording IP cameras is maybe better than a fleet of guards

## Cryptographic concepts
### Encryption
* a means to allow two parties, customarily called Alice and Bob, to establish confidential communication over an insecure channel that is subject to eavesdropping

### Cryptosystem Characteristics
Can be described by:
* the set of possible plaintexts
* the set of possible ciphertexts
* the set of encryption keys
* the set of decryption keys
* the correspondence between encryption keys and decryption keys
* the encyrption algorithm to use
* the decryption algorithm to use

### Symmetric Cryptosystems
* Alice and Bob share a secret key, which is used for both encryption and decryption 
* key distribution requires each pari of communicating parties to share a separate secret key
* requires ((n * (n-1) )/ 2) keys

### Public-Key Cryptography
* Uses public keys for encryption, private keys for decryption
* Only one key is needed for each recipient, with public and private components, n key pairs
* Can also be used to provide non-repudiation via signatures.  Use a private key to sign/encrypt, anyone can then use public key to decrypt for confirmation
	* Can also sign hash instead, slightly more secure

### Cryptographic Hash Functions
* A compression function that maps an arbitrary-length file/input to a fixed-length hash/output
* To be considered "cryptographic" a hash function must have the following properties
	* Must be "one-way", e.g. it is simple to compute the hash given  an input, but very difficult to get the input given only the hash
	* Should be collision-resistant, meaning that it should be very difficult to find two inputs that give the same hash output
* Message authentication codes
	* MAC enables data integrity, generated using hash function and a shared secret
	* similar to salting password hashes
	* recomputing hash with secret will show if file has been changed


# Control Systems
* Controlling complex systems like the power grid

## Introduction
* Understand and control segments of complex environments known as systems
* Room being heated system:
	* Temperature gauge
		* aka sensor
	* Room being heated
		* aka system or process
	* furnace
		* aka actuator
	* thermostat
		* aka controller
* Foundation provided by linear systems theory

## Open-Loop Conrol System
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img15.png)
* Defined as a system without feedback
	* e.g. a space heater

## Closed-Loop Control System
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img16.png)
* In contrast, closed-loop system uses a measure to compare actual output with desired output
	* e.g. home HVAC system instead of a space heater
* Many advantages over open-loop control

## Multi-Loop Feedback Control System
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L03_img17.png)
* Both inner and outer loops have controller and sensor

### Multivariable Control System
* As systems become complex, multiple sensors and controllers must all be kept in the loop and their behavior monitored and adjusted
	* e.g. humidity and pressure, in addition to temperature, for an HVAC system

## Automation
* The control of an industrial process by automatic rather than manual means
* Necessary for complex systems

## Productivity
* Defined here for our purposes as the ratio of physical output to physical input
