# Threats to CPS in Other Domains
## Health Care and Medicine
* For our purposes, these domains consist of:
	* Monitoring health conditions of the patients and taking necessary actions
	* Technologies related to home care, assisted living, smart operating rooms, smart medical devices, and smart prescriptions 

## Security and Privacy in Implantable Medical Devices
* In 2001, the estimated number of patients in the United States with an iimplantable medical device (IMD) exceeded 25 million

### Example Study
* A 2008 study analyzed the security and privacy properties on an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
	* This model of ICD includes pacemaker technology and is designed to communicate wirelessly with a nearby external programmer in the 175kh frequency range
	* The security and privacy properties of a common ICD were assessed and attacks on privacy, integrity, and availability were conducted
* What is an ICD?
	* An ICD is a device that monitors and responds to heart activity
	* ICDs have modes for pacing, wherein the device periodically sends a small electrical stimulus to the heart, and for defibrillation, wherein the device sends a larger shock to restore normal heart rhythm
	* A physician surgically implants the ICD below the patient's clavicle and close to the skin.  The physician also implants electrical leads that connect the ICD to the heart muscle
	* Post-surgery, a health care practitioner can use an external programmer to perform diagnostics, read and write private data, and adjust therapy settings
	* A malfunctioning or maliciously configured ICD could harm a patient in multiple ways
	* Inside the ICD is a magnetic switch.  A magnetic field in proximity to this switch causes it to close, which in turn causes the ICD to wirelessly transmit telemetry data, including electrocardiogram (EKG) readings
	* The ICD wirelessly communicates with the external programmer using the 175kHz band, which is intended for short-range communications
* The researchers reverse-engineered the communication protocol for the ICD, and implemented several software-radio-based attacks
	* Multiple impacts demonstrated.  Basically a fish in a barrel scenario.

## Intelligent Transportation
* Medium/large scale
* Improving safety, coordination, and services in traffic management and real-time info sharing
* Many benefits to both efficiency and safety

### Attacking Vehicle Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
* In 2016, researchers presented a study demonstrating attacks against these systems
* To minimize accidents and improve the driving experience, various advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been created
* Attacks on ADAS are emerging
* Attacks utilize the underlying principals of sensors to blind or deceive them, e.g. exploiting the active probing mechanisms that are used to detect barriers
	* Vehicle ADAS tricked into believing objects in the vehicle's way are no longer there, or tricked to make obstacles appear

### Vehicle Sensors
* Ultrasonic sensors
	* Proximity -- 2m
	* Proximity sensors that aim at detecting barriers within several meters from a car body.  They are mainly designed for low speed scenarios, e.g. parking assistance
* Forward-looking cameras
	* Short Range -- 30m
	* Used for lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, and backward cameras for parking assistance.  Short-range Millimiter-wave (MMW) radars (Short-range radar, SRR) serve for blind spot detection and cross traffic alert
* LiDAR and medium-range MMW radars (Medium-range radar, MRR)
	* Medium Range -- 80-160m
	* Operate in medium range and assist collision avoidance and pedestrian detection
* Long-range MMW radars (Long-range radar, LRR)
	* Long Range -- 250m
	* Designed for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) at high speeds

### What is Required for Sensor Attacks?
* Sensors relying on distinctive physical principles require different equipment
* Ultrasound transceivers used in exploit against ultrasonic sensors 
* Radio frequency (RF) transceivers used in exploit against MMW radars
* Lasers used in exploit against cameras
* No physical contact with the targeted sensors, thus the attacks were "contactless"

* This study launched both "spoofing" and "jamming" attacks
	* Spoofing attacks involved emitting carefully crafted signals similar to the real signals transmitted to the sensors normally.  Thus the sensors interpreted the spoofed signals as real ones, and responded accordingly.
	* Jamming attacks involved a very strong signal, which interfered with the real ones.
