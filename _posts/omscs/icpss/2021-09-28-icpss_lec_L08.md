# Industrial Network Design and Architecture

## Differences in Network Architectures by Function
* Industrial Network == any network that supports the interconnectivity of and communication between devices that make up or support an ICS
	* Can be LAN or WAN depending on type of ICS
* Historically discussions about network architecture have mostly been about business networks
* Business networks are:
	* highly interconnected
	* have various wireless connectivity options
	* extremely dynamic in nature
	* BYOD exacerbates this
	* So does remote access, such as VPN
	* Lots of internet-facing services
* Business network security focuses on the classic CIA, but availability is usually lowest priority out of those 3
	* Structurally, industrial networks are often similar, but availability is paramount
* ICS is usually hard-realtime, bandwidth and latency are critical
* This dictates which topologies are appropriate (e.g. ring or mesh) and may even call for purpose-built networking hardware
* Redundandancy is a path to availability.  One way to accomplish this is with multiple ethernet connections 
	* Redundancy may necessitate different routing or switching protocols, to enable efficiency in the presence of redundant network paths
* Lower-level protocols in Industrial networks are often more specialiazed
	* e.g. Foundation fieldbus protocol

## Network Topologies
* Industrial networks are usually distributed in nature, and vary considerably
	* As opposed to business networks, where IP and ethernet dominate
* Business networks are often implemented in many different topologies, such as mesh or star topologies
* Industrial networks will also often use bus or ring topologies
	* Have fallen out of favor for business networks
	* Ring topology supports high redundancy needed in industrial networks
	* Bus topology represents shared message transmission domain
* Network topology will have strong impacts on security and reliability, as well as ability to segment the network properly

## Network Segmentation
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L08_img1.png)
* Many easons for segmenting industrial networks:
	* Top 2 are: 
		* Performance
		* Security
* Segmentation usually done at layer 3 of protocol stack (network layer)
	* Can also be at layer 2 via VLAN
* Hierarchical network segmentation design means that communication between two networks may require traversal across multiple
	* e.g. in above picture going from Process Network B1a to Process Network B2c involves:
		* Process Network B1a -> Control Network B1 -> Supervisory Control Netwokr B -> Control Network B2 -> Process Network B2c

### Types of Communication Flow Control
* Absolute
	* No communication is allowed (i.e. all traffic is blocked in both directions)
* Conditional
	* Only explicitly defined traffic is allowed (e.g. via Access Control Lists, filters, etc)
* Bidirectional
	* Traffic is allowed in both directions.
	* Conditions may be enforced in both directions
* Unidirectional
	* Traffic is only allowed in one direction (e.g. via a data diaode or unidirectional gateway)

### Higher Layer Segmentation
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L08_img2.png)
* While network segmentation is usually done at Layer 3 ( via subnets) or Layer 2 (via VLANs), it can also be done at any layer in the stack
* This is called protocol filtering, or network whitelisting
	* It defines the network behaviors that are allowed
	* Defense in depth!
* Note, however, that as network segmentation increases, the overall end-to-end latency increases

### Physical Segmentation vs Logical Segmentation
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L08_img3.png)
* Refers to the use of two separate physical network devices to perform the isolation between networks
* The two networks show above are completely airgapped

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L08_img4.png)
* Refers to the use of logical functions within the same network device to achive isolation between networks
* In this example two different vlans are used in a single switch in a trunk connection to separate these networks
* In industrial networks, physical segmentation is still very widely used.
* Physical layer controls are also popular in highly critical areas, due to frequent use of multicast for low-latency communication

## Network Services
* e.g. identity, access management, or domain services
* Services are usually already in place for business network, but extending those same servers to the industrial network introduces risk
	* Thus, separate servers for those services should be maintained for those networks
	* This decouples risk between the zones
* In general, abide by the principle of least route, which states that in purpose-built networks, the nodes should only be given the connectivity needed to perform its function

## Wireless Networks
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L08_img5.png)
* Wireless networks may be used at any point within an industrial network
* Wireless networks are (obviously) more difficult to physically contain
	* Any device with an appropriate transceiver that is within range can receive and send wireless signals.  No cabling in necessary.
	* Conduct thorough radio frequency surveys to monitor this risk.
* The myriad of use cases for wireless in industrial networks has caused a proliferation of industrial wireless protocols
	* One such, wireless HART, is shown in the implementation above
	* A common use case (again, obviously) is to support connectivity for remote or physically difficult devices such as field devices
		* This makes power a consideration.  Often power is extracted from the same line used for communication (e.g. power over ethernet)
		* This means power availability (such as battery life) directly impacts the functioning of the relevant process.  Dead batteries on your sensors might mean a real bad time

## Remote Access
* Often necessary, sometimes to support vendors or similar
* All access points are an attack vector, and should only be used when necessary
* Best practices are:
	* Minimze attack vectors
		* Only provide one path for remote access
	* Principles of least privilege
		* Only allow remote access to targeted resources
	* Consider further segmentation
		* In service of least privilege. 
		* Wall off remotely accessible systems from others
	* Application control
	* No direct access
		* To critical or important systems
	* Strong security policy
		* Should be equal to or better than the policy in place for on-site access
	* Avoid remote storage of credentials
	* Ability to terminate connection locally
	* Log everything

## Network Performance
*   Four components of network performance are:
	*   Bandwidth
	*   Throughput
	*   Latency
	*   Jitter

### Latency and Jitter
*   Latency is the amount of time it takes for a packet to traverse a network from its source to its destination
	*   Usually represented as a round trip time (RTT)
	*   When traversing segmented networks, as shown above, each network hop will add latency
		*   The deeper into a packet a device must read to make a routing decision, the more latency will be added by the hop
			*   E.g. a layer 2 switch will add less latency than a layer 3 router, which will in turn add less latency than an application-layer firewall
*   Jitter is the variability in latency over time, as large amounts of data are transmitted across a network
	*   Can often be more disruptive to real-time communication across a network than latency alone
	*   If it is severe enough, timing will be lost.  This is unacceptable in the context of sensors, for example

### Bandwidth and Throughput
*   Bandwidth refers to the total amount of data that can be transmitted from one point to another in a given period of time
	*   Often measured in megabits per second or gigabits per second
	*   Depending on the type of network there may be contention
	*   Not usually a concern in industrial networks, as most industrial uses require very little bandwidth to operate
		*   Obviously some exceptions, especially newer devices
	*   However, industrial network designs must accomodate bursts of event-related data that can occur during disturbances
*   Throughput refers to the volume of data that can flow through a network
	*   Impacted by a variety of factors, such as medium, interference, device capabilities, selected protocols, etc. 
	*   Commonly measured in packets per second
	*   The correlation between bandwidth and throughput is dependent on many things, including size of packets and the protocols used
	*   A device that can transfer data at the full capability of the network is said to support "line rate throughput"

### Type/Class/Quality of Service
* When you have multiple nodes, contention can cause unwanted delays on the network
* Quality of Service (QoS) refers to the ability to differentiate and prioritize some traffic over other traffic
	* e.g. prioritizing real time communication over others
	* Type of Service (Layer 3) and Class of Service (Layer 2) provide the mechanisms for identifying the types of traffic, and are used by QoS to shape traffic
	* Every network device a packet encounters must process that traffic, and cause varying degrees of latency 
	* though modern devices are very fast and usually do not add much, though it can add up especially with higher-layer logic

## Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)
* Many ICS systems and Components are monitored by SIS
* SIS consist of many of the same types of devices as normal ICS
* SIS are designed to identify unsafe state, and put the system into a safe state
* Designed for maximum reliability and include diagnostics and redundancy. 
	* SIS must be available
* SIS may be integrated or hardwired in
* Co-existing SIS and OT devices introduces security risk
	* Important comply with the principle of least privilege
	* Important to consider failures and unsafe states

## Wide Area Connectivity (WAN)
* Some ICS such as the power grid are connected over WAN
	* substations, pipelines, oil rigs, etc
* Can be implemented over public infrastructure, or leased capabilities
* May be satelite, run wires, or over airwaves
* Must be given the same security considerations as all networks we've already discussed
	* Actually more, due to increased attack surface from physical accessibility
* Smart grid distributed PMUs are given as example, requiring GPS connectivity
