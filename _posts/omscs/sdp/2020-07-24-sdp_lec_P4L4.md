## Agile Development Method
* Equated here with TDD.  Not sure those are tightly coupled, personally

## Cost of Change - Enter Agile
* Cost of change grows exponentially with time
	* Later changes are way more expensive
* Discover errors early... requires upfront planning
* Thus, make large upfront investments in modeling?
	* This is the core value proposition of waterfall
* In the last 30 years, the equation has changed.  Compiling takes seconds instead of days, testing can be re-run automatically, etc etc.
	* As a result, costs of change are just lower, and doesn't scale up with time as badly as it used to
	* This is only true, obviously, if modern tools and practices are used
* If cost vs time is flat now:
	* upfront work is a liability
	* ambiguity, volatility -> good to delay
	* Only pay in time/money for what you use.  There is value in waiting
* Enter Agile!
	* 17 Devs signed Agile Manifesto in 2001
	* They aim at flat cost growth over time, via decreased overhead
	* Focus on the code instead of planning
	* Focus on people over process.  Reward people.
	* Emphasize iterative approaches.  Deliver fast, evolve fast.
	* Customer involvement
	* Expectation that requirements will change.
	* Focus on simplicity, both in design and code.  Be as simple as possible, but no more so.

### Extreme Programming (XP)
* XP is a lightweight methodology for small to medium sized teams developing softgware in the face of vague or rapidly changing requiremtns.  --Kent Beck
* What is XP
	* Lightweight
		* Does not overburden developers with process
	* Humanistic
		* Centered on people.  Notably developers and customers.
	* Discipline
		* Has tangible practices that must be followed
	* Software Development
* Mentality of sufficiency
	* How would you program if you had all the time in the world?
		* Write tests
		* Restructure often
		* Talk with fellow programmers and with the customer often
* XP Value and Principles
	* Communication - no good project without communication
		* Pair Programming
		* User Stories
		* Customer Involvement
	* Simplicity - use the simplest thing that works
	* Feedback - get some.  Use it.
		* Test cases
		* Estimate new user stories right away
	* Courage
		* Throw away what doesn't work
		* Try new things
		* Fix what's broken
* XP Practices
	* Incremental Planning
		* Based on the idea that requirements are written on story cards
		1. Select user stories for this release
			* Based on time available and priority
		2. Break stories into tasks
		3. Plan Release
		4. Develop, integrate, and test our code
			* obviously an iterative step
		5. Release software
		6. Evaluate system and iteration
	* Small Releases
		* Try to release very often
		* Advantages
			* Deliver real business value on very short cycle
			* Rapid feedback
			* Produces sense of accomplishment for developers
			* Reduces risk of going off course or having a big miss
			* Quickly adapt to changing requirements
	* Simple Design
		* Avoid creating huge complicated design
		* Just enough to meet the requirements
		* No duplicated functionality
		* Fewest possible classes and methods
	* Test-First Development
		* Any feature that does not have an automated test does not exist
		* Create unit tests before implementation
	* Refactoring
		* Refactor as soon as opportunities for improvement are found
		* Often when new code is to be added
	* Pair Programming
		* All production code is written with two people looking at one machine
		* One keyboard and one mouse
		* Alternate roles between programming and strategizing
		* Somewhat controversial practice
			* Prof is clearly in favor.  Suggests that studies show that you still get 2 devs worth of output
	* Continuous Integration
		* Don't allow problems to pile up and be discovered too late
		* Instead have a cycle
			* programming
			* local tests
				* repeat as needed
			* integrate
			* system tests
				* repeat as needed

	* On-site Customer
		* The customer is an actual member of the team
			* sits with the team
			* brings requirements to the team
		* Frequent objections that this is impractical in the real world
			* If the system isn't worth the salary of one member for X months, maybe it isn't worth building at all?  You're investing a lot more into that system than one salaray anyway.
* Requirements Engineering in XP
	* Requirements expressed as user stories
	* Written by clients on story cards
	* Taken by developers and broken down into tasks
	* Tasks are used as basis for scheduling and cost estimates
	* Given these estimates and based on their priorities, customer will choose which stories to be included in upcoming release
	* Selected tasks will then be completed
* Testing Strategy
	* Testing is coded confidence
	* Isolated and automated
	* 2 kinds of tests
		* Unit tests
			* test every meaningful feature
		* System Tests
			* aka Acceptance Tests, Integration Tests
			* Involves customer-provided test cases
			* run longer and lest frequently

### Scrum
* Actors
	* Product Owner
		* Manages the product backlog.
	* Team
		* responsible for making and delivering.  usually 4-9 people
	* Scrum master
		* responsible for overall scrum process.  facilitator.
* High level process
	* Product backlog
		* single source of requirements
		* ordered by priority
		* sometimes called WIP queue
	* Sprint planning
		* next increment is defined
		* backlog items of interest are selected, converted into tasks, estimated
	* sprint backlog
		* set of backlog items to be completed during next sprint
	* sprint
		* actual iteration of scrum development process
		* main part lasts 2-4 weeks
		* within main part are many daily scrums that last 24 hours
	* daily scrum
		* starts with scrum meeting.  15 minutes, early, for team to sync.  discussion of accomplishments since last meeting, to-do list before next meeting, and obstacle analysis
	* sprint review
		* end of a main sprint cycle
		* 4 hour meeting
		* demo
		* discuss problems encountered and resolved
		* in retrospective there's a stronger focus on process and potential process improvements
	* potentially shippable product increments
		* if something shippable is made, results in a release
