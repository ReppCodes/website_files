## Refactoring
* Process of applying transformations to a program so as to obtain a refactored program.
	* Improved design but with same functionality as the original program
	* Semantics preserving
	* Goal: keep program readable, understandable, and maintainable
	* Key feature: behavior preserving
		* How can we guarantee that?
		* No guarantees, but you can test it!
		* If you have a good test suite, that helps a lot.
		* Remember, there are no guarantees from testing alone.

## Why Refactor?
* Requirements change
	* often need to change design to acommodate
* Design needs to be improved
	* new feature, more maintainable, etc
* Sloppiness / laziness of developers
	* copy/paste programming abstracted into classes or libraries

## History of Refactoring
* Refactoring is something that programmers have always done
* Especially important for object-oriented languages
	* but useful for all languages
* Opdyke's PhD Thesis (1990) discusses refacotring for SMALLTALK
* Increasingly popular recently due to agile development adoption
* Fowler's Book - Improving the Design of Existing Code
	* Catalog of refactorings
	* List of bad smells
	* Guidelines on when to apply refactoring
	* Examples of code before and after

## Types of Refacotring
* Massive list, we will only cover a few
* Collapse Hierarchy
* A superclass and subclass are tgoo similar
	* Merge them
* Consolidate Conditional Expression
	* Set of conditionals with the same result
	* each check is different but the result is the same
	* Combine and extract checks

* Decompose Conditionals
	* A conditional statement is particularly complex
	* Might be too hard to parse why something does or doesn't happen
	* Extract condition to method call, leverage method name to explain what you're trying to test for

* Extract Class
	* a class may wind up doing the work of two or more, due to code evolution
	* creat a new class and move there the relevant fields/methods
* Inline Class
	* inverse of extracting a class
	* A class may wind up not doing much
		* move its features into another class and delete this one
* Extract Method
	* most common of the ones we've covered
	* cohesive code fragment in a large method
	* create a method using that fragment, and call that method where needed

## How to Refactor
* Full length demo shown here.  View video itself for refesher
* Uses demo of Eclipse.  Ugh.

## Refactoring Risks
* Powerful too, but...
* May introduce subtle faults
	* aka regression errors
* Should not be abused
	* performed only when needed
* should be used very carefully on systems in production

## Cost of Refactoring
* May be free with good tooling
* But often requires manual work, which costs
* Test development and maintenance, especially those built or added to specifically for a refactoring effort
* Documentation maintenance - changes to names or interfaces must be updated in docs, and that takes effort too

## When Not to Refactor
* When code is broken
	* Refactoring is not about fixing broken code, it's about design of code
	* Refactoring should never change code behavior, so **can't** fix broken code
* When a deadline is close
	* time spent on refactoring doesn't advance features
	* risk of regression errors increases risk of missing a deadline
* When there is no reason to!

## Bad Smells
* What are bad smells?
	* Symptoms in code that may indicate deeper problems
	* Usually not bugs, don't impair function
	* But indicate weaknesses in design
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p4l5_img4.png)
* Duplicated Code
	* Same piece of code replicated in multiple places
		* common from copy/paste programming
	* fixed by extract method refactoring
* Long method
	* extract method
	* decompose conditional
	* shorten and break down method to make it more cohesive
* Large class
	* extract class or subclass
	* break down class to multiple, each with more cohesive functionality
* Shotgun surgery
	* every time a change is made, have to go to many classes
	* functionality is spread among classes,  too much coupling and too little cohesion
	* move method/field, inline class
	* bring related functionality together, remove dependencies between classes
* Feature envy
	* refers to a method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it belongs to
	* extract method, move method to class it is referencing
		* decreases coupling between classes
