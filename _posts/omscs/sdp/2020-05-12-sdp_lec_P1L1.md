### Starting from the bottom...

* Class draws distinction between programming (smaller projects, single programmer)
	and software engineering/development (larger projects, team coordination)
* Central idea is that in the 60s amount of software needed far outstripped output
	capacity of individual programmers (teeing up idea that you need formal discipline to close that gap)
* Defines sfotware development as going from abstract idea to concrete, functioning software
	* Software development process is used to break up the path from A to B into digestible chunks
		* Systematic
		* Formal
		* Four main process types exist (will be covered in depth throughout class)
			* Watefall
			* Evolutionary prototyping
			* Rational unified process (aka Unified Software Process)
				* This is where UML comes in
			* Agile

* Software Development Phases
	* Requirements Engineering
	* Design
	* Implementation
	* Verification and Validation
	* Maintenance (including feature adds)
* Tooling
	* Better tooling helps close the gap between the growth curves of 
		developers productivity and software size and complexity
		* Includes improvement in IDEs, language, debugging, etc
	* Tools
		* IDEs
		* VCS
		* Coverage and Verification Tools
