## Software Engineering and UML

### Object Orientation
* Precedence of data over function
	* data is the center 
* Information hiding
	* encapsulation of data behind interfaces
	* makes code more maintainable.  nobody cares how its implemented, just inputs and outputs
* Inheritance
	* re-use of object definitions with incremental refinement
	* polymorphism = sub-classes can be used wherever their parent classes can be used

#### What is an object
* Object is a computing unit organized around a collection of state or instance variables
	* associated with operators that act on such state
	* operations are invoked by sending a message to an object
* Class is a blueprint from which new objects can be created.  Like a blueprint

#### Why do we use OO?
* Reduce maintenance costs by limiting the effect of chases
* Can modify parts of the system without affecting the rest of the system
* Improve development process
* Enforce good design

#### OOAD - OO Analysis and Design
* model a software system as a group of interacting objects
	* requirements analysis technique
* Rumbaugh methodology - 3 models - OMT
	* data 
	* functional
	* control - uses state machines to describe how a system would evolve while in use
	* grandfather of Unified Modeling Language (UML)
* From functional orientied to data oriented view
	* define system first in terms of data types
	* Focus on real world object and how they map to requirements
		1. obtain and prepare textual description of problem to be solved
		2. underline nouns -> classes
		3. underline adjectives -> attributes of classes
		4. underline active verbs -> operations

### Running Example: Course Management System
#### Class Diagram

![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img1.png)
* Classes
	* fairly simple, go find all the nouns, those are your classes
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img2.png)
* Attributes represent the structure of a class
	* May be found by:
		* examining class definitions
		* studying requirements
		* applying domain knowledge
	* e.g each **course offering** has a **number**, **location**, and **time**
* Operations
	* Represent the behavior of a class
	* May be found by examining interations among entities
	* e.g. **sutdents may use the system to add/drop courses**
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img3.png)
* Relationships between classes
	* describe interactios between objects
	* 3 main types
		1. dependency: x uses y
		2. assocations/aggregations: x has a y
		3. generalization: x is a y
	* dependency example:
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img4.png)
* association example
	* add adornments to the diagram to explain more detail about the association. e.g. what is the relationship, what direction does it go, how many y's can x have, etc
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img5.png)
* aggregation example
	* relationship between two classes where one represents a larger class (a whole) which consists of smaller ones (parts of the whole)
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img6.png)
* generalization example
	* relationship between a general class (superclass) and a more specific class (subclass) which refines the superclass.
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img7.png)

* class diagram creation tips
	* take time to understand the problem
	* choose good class names
	* concentrate on the WHAT (remember, classes are nouns)
	* start with a simple diagram, then refine it
	* refine until you feel it is complete

#### Component Diagram
* Static view of components in the system and their relationships
* Node = component
	* set of classes with a well-defined interface
* Edge = Relationship
	* "uses service of"
* can be used to represent an architecture
* example:
	* dashed are original UML, means 'x uses y'
	* lollipops are from UML 2, offer more detail
		* indicates a provided interface
	* socket indicates a required interface
	* all can be annotated
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img8.png)

#### Deployment Diagram
* provides a static deployment view of a system
* physical allocation of components ot computational units (e.g. client server system)
* node = computational unit
* edge = communication between units
* deployment example:
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img9.png)

#### Behavioral Diagram
* Use Case Diagram
	* represents 2 things
		1. sequence of interactions of outside entities (actors) with the system
		2. system actions that yield an observable result of value to the actors
	* describes the outside view of the system
	* aka scenarios, scripts, or user stories
	* notation
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img10.png)

* Use Case: Actor
	* entity: human or device
	* plays a role
		* an entity can play more than role
		* more than one entity can play the same role
	* may appear in more than one use case
* the behavior of a use case can be specified by describing its flow of events (formal or informal)
	* how the use case starts and ends
	* normal flow of events
	* possible alternative flow of events
	* exceptional flow of events
* Role of use cases
	* requirements elicitation
	* architectural analysis
	* user prioritization
	* planning
	* testing
* creation tips
	* use a name that communicates purpose
	* define one atomic behavior per use case
	* define flow of events clearly
	* provide only essential details
	* factor common behaviors and variants (see additional UML documentation for details on how to do this)

* Sequence Diagram
	* interaction diagram that emphasizes the time ordering of messages
	* place objects that initiate interaction on the left, and place increasingly more subordinate objects to the right.  this should reflec the way that events will typically flow.
	* add object lifeline with vertical lines from each object
	* add messages to these lifelines in order from top to bottom, linked from sending object on left to receiving object on right
	* add focus of control.  tall thin bar showing where each object is active during its lifetime.
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l2_img11.png)

* State Transition Diagram
	* For each relevant class - shows life history of that object
		* possible states of the class
		* events that cause a transition from one state to another
		* actions that result from a state change
	* course offering example
