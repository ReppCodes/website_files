## Requirements Gathering

* Very difficult task.  Business people don't wanna.
* Brainstorming tasks.  example requirement, user wants tool to find average length of sentences in an essay
	* good example questions would be
		1. What OSes should it run on?
		2. How will the user specify input?

* avoid implementation-specific questions
* avoid OS-specific code where possible (platform independent is better)
* Example questions from interview
	* How many students?
		* 40-45 per class, 3 classes
	* What kind of computers are students using?
		* Doesn't know, probably several.
	* How tech savvy are the students?
		* Wide range
	* What are the students submitting?
		* Raw text files via email
	* What constitutes a word?
		* Only wants larger words, guesses 3 letters?
		* Need flexibility here
	* What do you consider a sentence?
		* Ends in period, exl point, etc.
		* Seems to be unsure, e.g. about commas counting
		* Need flexibility here
	
* Concludes CLI java-based tool with good documentation.  Lots of little error messages to help less tech savvy students with CLI usage
	* Core metric is avg number of words per sentence
	* Configurability about threshold word length
	* Configurability about what counts as a sentence
	* Results are avg number of words per sentence
	* Help messages if tool used incorrectly

#### Assignment 3 Requirements
* must use vanilla Java 1.6 or later, no libraries
* must compile with javac, no options
* executable from command line
* user specifies file path
* user specifies delimiters with -d
* user specifies word length lower limit with -l
* output must be average sentence length in words, rounded to two decimal places

## Requirements Engineering
* What are software requirements?
	* A description of what a system has to do.
		* Functionalty and features
	* Represented formally as text / shall statements
	* Represented non-textually as user stories or diagrams, etc.
* What is requirements engineering?
	* Working with stakeholders to elicit their requirements for the system
	* Analyzing those requirements to understand tradeoffs
	* Specification
	* Validation
	* Requirements management
		* Change management, feature adds, etc.
* Why is it important?
	* Failed projects if you screw this up.  
	* If you don't understand requirements, you're going to build the wrong system
	* Need to ask all the right stakeholders.
	* Gets the project off on the right foot.
* The process of establishing the services that the customer requires of the system, and the constraints under which the system operates
* Focus on what the system needs to do, not how it will do so
* Software intensive system = softare + hardware + context
* Software quality is not just a function of the software, but of the combination of the software and its purpose.  
	* Software can be of low quality not only because it doesn't work well, but also because it does not fulfill its needed purpose.
* Completeness and Pertinence
	* Very difficult to gain a complete picture of the purpose of the softare.  Often incomplete requirements are gathered
	* Pertinance = relevance.  Often include unneeded functionality.  Can also rake in conflicting requirements

### Best Practices

##### Typical bad practice
* Devs list off requirements, stakeholders review/edit/approve
* Often stakeholders don't bother / can't make time, so just skip to approving
* SOUND FAMILIAR?

#### How to avoid?
* RE is a **set of activities** concerned with **identifying and communicating** the **purpose** of a software-intensive system, and the **context** in which it will be used.  Hence, RE acts as the bridge between the **real-world needs** of users, customers, and other **constituencies** affected by a software system, and the **capabilities and opportunities** afforded by software-intensive technologies
* Requirements are:

* Functional and non-functional requirements
	* functional = well-defined, system shall do X
	* non-functional = system's qualities e.g. security, re-usability, speed, etc.  squishier.
		* non-functional must be refined to be verifiable
* User vs System Requirements
	* user requirements are written for customers. often in natural language, no technical details
	* system requirements are written for developers, contain detailed functional and non-functional requirements.  clearly and more rigorously specified
* Where do requirements come from?
	* Stakeholders - users want stuff
	* Application Domain - constraints applied here.  E.G. regulations for banking software
	* Documentation
* Elicitation Problems
	* Thin spread of domain knowledge.  Hard to run down all the people who know what all you need to know.
	* Knowledge is tacit.  Stuff as actually done rarely matches exactly to what people describe.
	* Limited observability - hard to shadow enough to get clear requirements.
	* Bias.  People may not want to, or be able to, accurately relay to you the way things actually work.
* Traditional techniques for requirement elicitation
	* Background reading - collecting information by reading existing documents.  Especially good when not familiar with the org.  Saves time spent interviewing actual people.  However docs are often bad or out of date.
	* Hard data and samples
	* Interviews - this is very common.  Structured or open-ended.  Can collect rich set of information.  However, require special skills to do well.
	* Surveys - very useful and allow casting a broader net.  However, only good at capturing expected information of certain types.
	* Meetings - fundamental that clear agenda is set.
	* Other techniques
		* collaborative techniques - brainstorming, 
		* social approaches,
		* ethnographic techniques (observe stakeholders in original environment)
		* cognitive techniques
* Modeling requirements
	* modeling enterprises
		* goals and objecticves
		* organizational structure
		* tasks and dependencies
		* agents, roles, intentionality
	* modeling information and behaviors
		* information structure
		* behavioral view
			* scenarios and use cases
			* state machine models
			* sequence diagrams
			* information flow
		* time/sequencing requirements
	* modeling system qualities (NFRS)
		* robustness, reliability, etc
		* 
	* after deciding what to model, must decide how you want to model it
		* there are tons of different models you can choose for each different thing you want to model.  frequently they're complementary, they can reinforce and aid each other
* For this course, we'll use either natural language or UML diagrams for our requirements
	* goal modeling is very popular.  start with main goal of system, then refine by decomposing into nested subgoals until you get to units of functionality

* Analyzing requirements
	* Verification
		* check whether they're correct, complete, and pertinent, consistent, testable, etc.
	* Validation
		* assess whether collected requirements describe the system the stakeholders actually want
		* sometimes done by allowing stakeholders to interact with a prototype
	* Risk analysis
		* aims to identify and analyze main risks involved with development of the system being built
* Requirements prioritization
	* how to handle limited resources?
	* prioritize by classifying
		* mandatory
		* nice to have
		* superfluous

#### Recap
* 3 main steps
	* elicitation
	* modeling
	* analysis
* 4th kinda step - negotiation between stakeholders and devs
* Iterative process between all 4 stages until you are happy, then you stop.
* Requirements shoudl be simple, not compount
* Requirements should be testable
* Requirements should be organized, grouped, nested, prioritized 
* Requirements should be numbered (for traceability)

* Software requirement specification (SRS) (document)
	* way to communicate requirements to others - common ground between analysts and stakeholders
	* different projects require different SRS
	* For this class we'll use modified version of the IEEE standard SRS document
