## Android Programming
* Android runs in Dalvik VM.  Runtime for Java, optimized for mobile
* Basic architecture (descending order)

### Activities
* A single screen with a UI (e.g. phone dialer)
* Independent units, work together to form a cohesive whole
* Create an activity by extending the Activity class in the Android framework


### Services
* A component that performas a usually long-running activity in the background, not interacting with the user.
	* No UI, obviously
* Create a service by extending the Service class in the Android framework
* A way to tell the system something needs to keep happening even if app is closed

### Content Provider
* provides a structured interface to a set of data
* sqlite data is android setup for database.  frequently this is where you tie to with content provider
* sometimes also used by app to share data with other apps
	* e.g. address book / contacts app sharing with other apps that want it

### Broadcast Receiver
* Receiver that can be registered to receive system or application events
* sounds like a 'listener' to me

### Intents
* Connect above components
* Abstract description of an operation to be performed
* consists of 2 main parts
	1. action to be performed (e.g. "call")
	2. data action operates on (e.g. "phone number")
* Provide developers with a way to perform late binding between applications at runtime
* How can this be done?
	* Binding
		1. direct(activity)
		2. direct(service)
		3. broadcast (delivered to all receivers)
			* this is why when you click a phone number you have to pick which app takes it.  you broadcasted a call intent and each receiver chimed in that it could take it

### Manifests
* An XML file that declares all of the components of your app (broadcast receivers can be declared either here or at runtime)
* All the permissions required for your app to work
* Specifies the entry point for your app (which activity must be started to start the app)
* Declares version of the app
* Declares the lowest Android SDK for which the app is valid

### Android Activity Lifecycle

* Apps get interrupted all the time.   Apps must be able to deal with this.  Gracefully if possible.
