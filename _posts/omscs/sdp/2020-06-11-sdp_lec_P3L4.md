## Unified Software Process

### History of Rational Unified Process (RUP)
* In 1997, Rational defined six best practices for modern software engineering:
	* Develop iteratively, focusing on risk
	* Manage requirements
	* Employ a component-based architecture
	* Model software visually
	* Continuously verify quality
	* Control changes

### Key Features of RUP
* Software process model
	* Defines order of phases to be followed
	* Prescribes transition criteria
* Component-based
	* Software components are building blocks of software system
	* Well-defined interfaces between these components
* Tightly related to UML
	* relies extensively on UML for notation and basic principles
* Use-Case Driven
* Architecture-centric
	* good way to understand - "use cases define the function of the system, while architecture defines the form"
	1. create rough outline of system
	2. key use cases -> subsystems
	3. Refine architecture using addtional use cases
* Iterative and incremental
	* each cycle/increment results in a product release
		* including documents, training, etc.  all of it
	* each cycle further divided into 4 phases
		1. Inception
			* From idea to vision of end product
			* Delimit project scope
			* Business case for the product presented
			* What are the major users and what will the system do for them?  Simplified use case model 
			* What could be an architecture for the system?  Tentative architecture
			* What is the plan and how much will it cost?  Main risks identified, rough planning
			* Deliverables
				* Vision document with general vision of the core project's requirements, key features, and main cconstraints
				* Initial use-case model
				* Initial project glossary
				* Initial business case
				* Initial project plan and risk assessment
				* Optionally, one or more prototypes
			* Evaluation Criteria
				* Stakeholder concurrence on scope, definition, and cost/schedule estimates
				* Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases
				* Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process
				* Depth and breadth of any prototype that was developed
				* Project may be cancelled or considerably re-thought if it fails to pass this milestone
		2. Elaboration
			* Analyze problem domain
			* Establish architectural foundation
			* Eliminate highest risk elements (address most critical use cases)
			* Refine plan of activites and estimate
			* Deliverables
				* Almost complete use-case model
				* Supplementary requirements, including non-functional requirements
				* Software architecture
				* Design model, test cases, executable prototype
				* Revised project plan and risk assessment
				* Preliminary user manual
			* Evaluation Criteria
				* Are vision and architecture stable?
				* Does the protytpe show that the major risks have been addressed/resolved?
				* Is the plan sufficiently detailed/accurate?
				* Do all stakeholders agree that the vision can be achieved with the current plan?
				* Is the actual resource expenditure versus planned expenditure acceptable?
				* Project may be cancelled or considerably re-though if it fails to pass this milestone.
		3. Construction
			* All features considered developed
			* All features thoroughly tested
			* Shift in emphasis from IP development to product development
			* Deliverables
				* All use cases realized, with traceability information
				* Software product integrated on adequate platforms
				* Complete system test results
				* User manual
				* Complete set of artifacts: desigtn, code, test cases, etc.
			* Evaluation Criteria
				* Is the product stable/mature enough to be deployed to users?
				* Are the stakeholders ready for the transition into the user community?
				* Are actual resource expenditures versus planned expenditures still acceptable?
				* Transition may be postponed by one release if the project fails to pass this milestone.
		4. Transition
			* Issues after deployment -> new release
			* Training customer service and providing help-line assistance
			* A new cycle may start
			* Deliverables
				* Project completed
				* Product in use
				* Lessons learned
				* Plan for next release
			* Evaluation Criteria
				* Is the user satisfied?
				* Are actual resource expenditures versus planned expenditures still acceptable?
		* inside each phase there may be multiple iterations.  each iteration corresponds to a set of use cases (aka set of features).
	* Example:

	* Work is distributed across each phase within a cycle
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p3l4_img2.png)
	* Within each iteration, multiple steps are taken
		* Identify relevant use cases
		* Create a design
		* Implement the design
		* Verify code against use cases
		* Release a product
