## What is an Operating System?
* A special piece of software that abstracts and arbitrates the use of a computer system
* An operating system is like a toy shop manager
	* Directs operational resources
	* Enforces working policies
	* Mitigates difficulty of complex tasks
* Formal definition: An operating systems is a layer of systems software that:
	* Directly has privliged access to the underlying hardware
	* Hides hardware complexity
	* Manages hardware on behalf of one ofor more applications according to some predefined policies
	* In addition, it ensures that applications are isolated and protected fro mone another
* OS Examples:
	* Desktop
		* Microsoft Windows
		* Unix-Based
			* Max OS X (BSD)
			* Linux
				* Ubuntu, RHEL, etc
				* This class will mostly focus on Linux
	* Embedded
		* Android
			* Embedded form of Linux
		* iOS
			* Apple Proprietary
		* Symbian
* OS Elements
	* Abstractions
		* Process, thread, 
		* file, socket, memory page
	* Mechanisms
		* Create, schedule
		* open, write, allocate
	* Policies
		* least-recently used,
		* earliest deadline first
	* Memory Management Example
		* Abstraction = memory page
		* Mechanism = allocate, map to a process
		* Policy = least-recently used
* Design Principles
	* Separation of mechanism & policy
		* implement flexible mechanisms to support many policies
		* e.g. least-recently used and least-frequently used memory page swap algorithms require a mechanism for tracking and timing usage
	* Optimize for common case
		* Need to understand some questions to make correct design choices for an OS.
		* where will the OS be used?
		* What will the user want to execute on that machine?
		* What are the workload requirements?
* User/Kernel Protection Boundary
	* user-level
		* applications operate in user mode
	* kernel-level
		* because we need direct hardware access, OS must operate in kernel mode
	* crossing from user to kernel level or vice versa is supported by hardware in most modern platforms
		* privilege bit in CPU.  when set we can do kernel mode things
		* attemps to perform privileged operations when in user mode will cause a trap.  the application will be interrupted and control will be handed back to OS.  OS will verify and either grant access or terminate process.
		* In addition to traps, there are system calls.  Applications can invoke these to request the OS to perform privileged operations on their behalf.
			* e.g. open(file), send(socket), malloc(memory)
		* Signals
			* mechanism for OS to pass information back into applications.  discussed in a later lesson
* System Call Flowchart

	* Arguments for system calls can be passed directly from application to OS, or indirectly by storing in a register and passing address locations
	* In synchronous mode the process will wait until the system call completes.  There is also an async mode, to be discussed in a later section
* In summary User/Kernel transitions are a necessary part of running an application
	* Applications may need to access certain hardware or request resources.  Only OS Kernel can perform those
	* Performing system call and context switches is very slow, can take hundreds of cycles.  Pages out some application data to bring in necessary kernel data.  Not a cheap process.

* Monolithic OS
	* all services are part of the OS.  e.g. file system (multiple kinds), processes, threads, etc.
	* Pros
		* everything included
		* inlining, compile-time optimizations
	* Cons
		* big and unwieldy
		* customization, portability, manageability
		* memory footprint
		* performance concerns
* Modular OS
	* many services and APIs included, but everything can be added as modules.  allows for reconfiguration based on needs for a given workload
	* Pros
		* easier to maintain and upgrade
		* smaller footprint
		* less resource needs
	* Cons
		* indirection can impact performance.  jumping through module interface hoops
		* maintenance can still be an issue.  modularity can make synchronization hard and introduce bugs
* Microkernel
	* only include most basic primitives at OS level (address space, threads).  all other components run outside of OS at user level.  requires lots of inter-process communication, usually supported by OS
		* Pros
			* very small, easer to verify and test
		* Cons
			* portability
			* complexity of software development
			* cost of user/kernel crossing
* Linux and Mac OS Architectures
