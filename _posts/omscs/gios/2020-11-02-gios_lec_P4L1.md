## Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
### Why RPC? 
* Example 1: Getfile App
	* client-server
	* create and init sockets
	* allocate and populate buffers
	* include 'protocol' information
		* getfile, size, ...
	* copy data into buffers
		* filename, file, ...
* Example 2: ModImage App
	* client-server
	* client uploads images, then requests server to modify images
	* steps required of this would be very similar to GetFile app
		* one big difference is that protocol-related information would have to specify a lot, e.g. algorithm, parameters, etc
* It became obvious in the 80s that a lot of the boilerplate for distributed apps was being rewritten every time
* Common steps relates to remote IPC were then abstracted to Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

### Benefits of RPC
* RPC is intendended to simplify the development of cross-address space & cross-machine interactions
* Higher-level interface for data movement & communication
* Error handling
* Hiding complexities of cross-machine interaction

### RPC Requirements
* Client/server interaction model
	* server runs some complex service
	* clients don't need to be able to do the service thing, just issue requests to the server
* Procedure call interface 
	* synchronous call semantics
		* this means client will make call to server, then block until call completes and returns.  same as a procedure call locally.
* Type checking
	* useful for error handling
	* useful for packet bytes interpretation
* Cross-machine conversion
	* e.g. big/little endian
	* differences in representation of floating point numbers, negative numbers, etc
	* one solution is to have the rpc runtime on both sides of the pipe agree on all the formats, for instance everything in the "network" format
* Higher-level Protocol
	* incorporate higher level mechanisms, such as: access control, fault tolerance, ...
	* should support different transport protocols under the hood

### Structure of RPC
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p4l1_img1.png)

* Client wants to do something, but doesn't know how.  Only knows what operations are available.  
* Client sends desired operations to server, server performs them, server sends results back to client
* Client also needs things like server IP and such for RPC to handle the communication

### Steps in RPC
0. Register -- server registers procedure, arg types, location, etc.  All information needed for RPC use.
1. Bind -- client finds and binds to desired server.  
2. Call -- client makes PRC call; control passed to stub, client code blocks
3. Marshall -- client stub "marshalls" arguments (serialize args into buffer)
4. Send -- client sends message to server using whatever transmission protocol the client and server agreed to during the binding process
5. Receive -- server receives message; passes message to server-stub; possible access control checks if needed
6. Unmarshall -- server stub unmarshalls args (extracts args & creates data structs)
7. Actual call -- server stub calls local procedure implementation
8. Result -- server performs operation and computes result of RPC operation
9. Similar steps on return, in reverse

### Interface Definition Language (IDL)
* The nice thing about RPC is that client and server don't have to be developed together.  Could be a different developer, different languages even.
* For that to work, there must be some agreement about what the server can do, and what arguments are required for the various operations.
	* This is so the client can decide which server it should bind with
	* Standardizing these agreements are important also so that the RPC library can automatically generate the stubs
* These needs are addressed by IDLs

#### Specifying an IDL
* An IDL is used to desribe the interface the server exports
	* At minimum, must include procedure name, and arguments and their types.  Similar to a function signature.
	* Must also include a version number.  If there are multiple servers that provide a procedure, this helps the client know which server has the most current version of that procedure. Also, version #s make it easier to efficiently do upgrades.
* RPC can use IDL that is:
	* language-agnostic
		* example given: XDR (eXternal Data Representation) from SunRPC
			* different from any other language, is its own thing
			* if you don't have an IDL in the working language and have to learn one anyway, might as well learn a simple and universal one
		![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p4l1_img2.png)
	* language-specific
		* example given: Java in Java Remote Method Invocations (RMI)
			* nice if you already know Java, don't have to learn some new syntax
		![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p4l1_img3.png)
	* Only an interface, NOT IMPLEMENTATION!

### Marshalling and Unmarshalling
* Variables of an RPC function are scattered in client address space
* Client passes variables to rpc function, those variables must be sent via a buffer to the server
* Buffer is automatically generated by marshalling code, known as serialization
	* This is particularly useful when the function inputs are complex structures, such as arrays.  
	* Marshalling process must encode the data to an agreed-upon format, and this can get hairy if done manually
* Unmarshalling, as expected, takes the agreed upon encoding and uses it to extract the function variables from the buffer

### Binding and Registry
* Binding
	* Client determines
		* Which server should it connect to?
			* Based on things like service name, version number, etc.
		* How will it connect to that server?
			* Discover things like IP address, network protocol, etc.
* Registry
	* database of available services
	* search for service name to find service and contact details
	* Could be distributed
		* Any RPC service could register here
	* Could be machine-specific
		* for services running on the same machine
		* clients would have to know the machine address
			* registry could provide port number needed for connection
	* Regardless of how it's implemented, a naming protocol is necessary
		* e.g. exact match of name and version # for "add" function
		* or, could have some matching logic, and also match to things like "sum", "summation", etc.

### Pointers in RPC
* Pointers as arguments to RPC procedures are tricky.  Very normal for local procedures, but obviously address space is different on remote server.
* Solutions
	* no pointers!
	* serialize pointers
		* copy referenced data structure to send buffer.  Dereferencing instead of just copying the pointer.
		* On arrival at the server, the argument will be copied to address space and then used as a pointer properly

### Handling Partial Failures
* When a client hangs... what's the problem?
	* server down? service down? network down? message lost?
	* timeout and retry help, but offer no guarantees
* Special RPC notification (signal, exception, etc)
	* tries to catch all possible ways in which the RPC call can (partially) fail without claiming to provide the exact detail.

### SunRPC
* Developed in 80s by Sun for UNIX.  Now widely available on other platforms
* Design Choices
	* Binding => per-machineregistry daemon
	* No assumption regarding programming language used by client or server
	* IDL => XDR (for interface specification and for encoding)
	* Pointers => allowed and serialized
	* Failures => retries contacting server on timeout for N number of times. Return as much information as possible, meaningful errors where available.
* Client-server via procedure calls, follows normal RPC structure as described above
	* binding creates an rpc handle
	* client uses handle in calls
	* rpc runtime uses handle to track per-client RPC state
* Client and server may be on the same or different machines
	* really all RPC works like this
* Documentation, tutorials, and examples now maintained by Oracle
	* [SunRPC Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-1435/index.html)
	* TI-RPC == Transport-Independent SunRPC
		* The protocol used for the client-server communication need not be specified at compile time
	* Otherwise follows SunRPC/XDR as described above.  Includes docs and code examples.
	* Older online references still relevant
	* Linux man pages -- man rpc
	* RPC is not inherently thread-safe by default
		* rpcgen -C square.x => not thread safe, race conditions on several objects
			* y = squareproc_1(&x, client_handle)
		* rpcgen -C -M square.x => multithreading safe
			* status = squareproc_1(&x, &y, client_handle)
			* doesn't actually make a multithreaded "_svc.c" server
				* on Solaris "-a" => MT server
				* on Linux has to be done manually

* Compiling SunRPC

* SunRPC Registry
	* RPC daemon == portmapper
		* /sbin/portmap (need sudo priviliges)
		* used by both servers and clients
			* client use is easy, it's on the machine
			* query with rpcinfo -p
				* returns program id, version, protocol, socket port number, service name, etc. for every RPC service registered on that machine
			* portmapper runs with both tcp and udp on port 111
* SunRPC Binding
	* returns client handle of data type client*
		* used for tracking information such as stratus, errors, authentication, etc.

* XDR Data Types
	* default types (usually in C too)
		* char, byte, int, float, etc
	* additional XDR types
		* const (#define)
		* hyper (64-bit integer)
		* quadruple (128-bit float)
		* opaque (~ C byte)
			* uninterpreted binary data
		* arrays
			* fixed-length array
				* e.g. int data [80]
			* variable-length array
				* e.g. int data <80>
				* angular brackets denote the max expected length
				* when compiled, translates into a data structure with "len" and "val" fields
				* EXCEPT FOR STRINGS
					* string line<80> => c pointer to char
					* stored in memory as a normal null-terminated string
					* encoded (for transmission) as a pair of length and data, similar to other variable-length data structures
* XDR Routines
	* marshalling/unmarshalling
		* found in square_xdr.c
	* clean-up
		* xdr_free()
		* user_defined _freeresult procedure
			* e.g. square_prog_1_freeresult
		* called after results returned
* Encoding
	* What actually goes on the wire
		* RPC header
			* service procedure ID, version number, request ID, etc.  So server actually knows what it's getting
				* server must also respond with this information, for same reason
		* Actual data
			* transport header
				* e.g. TCP, UDP information
			* arguments or results
			* encoded into a byte stream depending on data type
	* XDR == IDL + the encoding
		* i.e. the binary representation of data on the wire
	* XDR Encoding rules
		* all data types are encoded in multiples of 4 bytes
			* so a single-byte data type would result in 1 byte of data and 3 bytes of padding
		* big endian is used as the transmission standard
			* data must first be translated if not already in this format
			* may cause extra overhead, but consistency and clarity is worth it
			* two's complement is used for integers
			* IEEE format is used for floating point

#### Java Remote Method Invocations (RMI)
* Pioneered by Sun as a form of client-server communication among address spaces in the JVM
* mataches Java OO semantics
* IDL == Java (language-specific

![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p4l1_img9.png)
* RMI Runtime
	* Remote reference layer
		* captures all the common code needed to provide different reference semantics.  Abstracts over the transport layer.
		* unicast, broadcast, return-first response, return-if-all-match, etc.
	* Transport layer
		* TCP, UDP, shared memory, etc.
