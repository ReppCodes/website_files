## What is a Process
* Simple definition - an instance of an executing program.  Sometimes called a task or a job.
* OS manages hardware on behalf of applications
	* Application == program on disk, flash memory, etc.  A static entity.
	* Process == state of a program when executing loaded in memory.  An active entity
		* Execution state of an application
	* Same application can be run multiple times, each as its own process

## What does Does a Process Look Like
* A process encapsulates all of the state of a running application
* Address space is an OS abstraction to capture all of this state.
* Types of state:
	* text and data
		* static state when process first loads
	* heap
		* dynamically created during execution
	* stack
		* grows and shrinks
		* LIFO queue

### Process Address Space
* Address space == 'in memory' representation of a process
* V0 to Vmax represent the range of virtual addresses used by process
	* Called virtual because it does not necessarily need to correspond to physical memory locations
* Physical addresses are locations in physical memory (DRAM)
	* Hardware and OS maintain a mapping from physical memory to virtual memory
	* Page tables == mapping of virtual to physical addresses

### Address Space and Memory Management
* Not all processes require all address space from V0 to VMax
	* Parts of virtual address space may not be allocated
	* May not be enough physical memory for all state
* OS dynamically decides which portion of which address space will be stored in physical memory, and where.
	* Multiple processes may share physical memory
	* All such process may have portions of their state swapped out to hard disk, to be brought in if and when needed
* OS may also perform memory access validity checks to ensure that a process has permission to access the specific memory it is trying to

### Process Execution State
* How does the OS know what a process is doing?
* Before a process can execute it must be compiled into binary
* OS must know where in a process' binary instructions it is.  This is done with a program counter (PC)
	* Kept in a CPU register
	* Other registers keep other information about other pieces of state
	* Also need a stack pointer, keep track of where the top of the stack is, to track that component of state
* OS maintains a process control block (PCB) to track miscellaneous other peices of state.  

### What is a Process Control Block
* A PCB is maintained for every process being managed by OS

* PCB is created and initialized when process is created 
* Certain fields are updated as relevant peices of state change
* Other fields change too frequently for that, so CPU keeps dedicated register for those, such as PC register.
* OS must collect and save PCB for every process whenever that process is no longer running on the CPU

### How is a PCB Used?
* Whenever there is a context switch between processes, state is saved from and loaded to the PCB

### What is a Context Switch
* Context switch == switching the CPU from the context of one process to the context of another
* Expensive
	* Direct costs: number of cycles for load and store instructions
	* Indirect costs: Cold cache and cache misses.  Reading multiple levels of cache down, and maybe even out of memory.
	* As a result we want to limit frequency of context switching!

### Process Lifecycle
* Processes can be in any of a number of states
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l1_img3.png)
* Process Creation
	* Processes can create new processes, and all processes forked off from the same original parent -- init(1) on Unix, ZYGOTE for Android apps
	* Some processes will be privileged, boot processes.  When a user logs in, a user shell process is created, and new processes are spawned from that shell.
	* Two main mechanisms for process creation
		* Fork 
			* copies the parent PCB into new child PCB
			* child continues execution at instruction after fork -- same PCB means same program counter, so keep counting forward from same spot
		* Exec
			* replace child image, loads new PCB
			* load new program and start from first instruction in that program's counter
		* Often used in combination, to create new child program with fork and then tee up something completely different than parent with exec

### Role of the CPU Scheduler
* For CPU to start executing a process, it must be ready
* However, there will often be multiple process in the ready queue.  Need to pick the right one to give to CPU next
* A CPU Scheduler determines which one of the currently ready processes will be dispatched to the CPU to start running, and how long it should run for.
* OS must:
	* preempt == interrupt currently executing process and save its context
	* schedule == run scheduler to choose next process
	* dispatch == dispatch process onto CPU and switch into its context
	* BE EFFICIENT ABOUT ALL THIS

### Length of Process
* How long should a process run for?
* How frequently should we run the scheduler?
	* More often we run it, more time we spend dinking around with scheduling instead of doing work

![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l1_img5.png)
* timeslice == time since Tp allocated to a process on the CPU
* Scheduling Design Decisions
	* What are appropriate timeslice values?
	* Metrics to choose next process to run?

### What about I/O?

### Inter Process Communication
* Can processes interact?  - Yes!  OS Must provide
* These days more and more applications are actually multiple processes
	* e.g. web server front end and database backend
* OS goes to great lengths to protect and isolate processes from each other.  IPC has to be built around these protections.
* Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanisms:
	* Transfer data/info between address spaces
	* Maintain protection and isolation
	* Provide flexibility and performance
* Message-passing IPC:
	* OS provides communication channel, like shared buffer
	* Processes write/read messages to/from channel
	* Pros
		* OS manages the channel and provides APIs
	* Cons
		* Overhead.  Lots of extra reads/writes for communication
* Shared memory IPC:
	* OS establishes a shared channel and maps it into each process address space
	* Processes directly read/write from this memory
	* Pros
		* OS is out of the way!
	* Cons
		* Reimplement code to handle all the safe reading/writing from shared memory
