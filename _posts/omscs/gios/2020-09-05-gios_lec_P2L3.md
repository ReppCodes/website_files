## PThread Creation
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l3_img1.png)
* pthread_attr_t
	* specified in pthread_create
	* defines featuress of nrew thread
		* stack size
		* joinable
		* priority
		* inheritance
		* scheduling policy
		* system/process scope
	* has default behavior with NULL in pthread_create
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l3_img2.png)
* detaching pthreads
	* default: joinable thread
	* parent thread should not exit until children threads have joined back
	* if parent exits early you get zombies
	* in pthreads you can detach children such that they cannot be joined, and can continue on after parent is killed
	* int pthread_detach() - takes thread as argument
	* for detached threads, must be killed off using void pthread_exit()
example:

There is a typo @4:58 with the code example. The pthread_create() function should be passed the following parameters:
`pthread_create(&tid, &attr, foo, NULL)`

#### Compiling Pthreads
* need `#include <pthread.h>` for library
* need to link at compile time.  which flag depends on platform. 
	* `gcc -o main main.c -lpthread`
	* `gcc -o main main.c -pthread`
* check return values of common functions!  always good, but extra needed here

#### Example 1
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l3_img4.png)
* Create threads with default attributes (first NULL in pthread create)
* Pass no arguments to threads (second NULL in pthread create)
* Default configuration of pthread is joinable, so can pass to pthread_join() without issue

#### Example 2
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l3_img5.png)
* Threads each execute a function that takes an argument, *pArg, so we pass &i as the argument to each pthread_create call

#### Example 3
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l3_img6.png)
* passing global variables to pthread_create arg is dangerous.  May not pass what you expect, as the variable may be updated globally before thread can execute whatever they use it for
* This is called a data race, or race condition.  This is when a thread tries to read a value while another thread modifies it
* Fix:
![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l3_img7.png)
	* create static copy of argument that isn't modified so it will always be passed and consumed correctly by appropriate thread

## PThread Mutexes
* Mutexes provide the mechanism to solve mutual exclusion problems among concurrent threads

* Mutex safety tips
	* each piece shared data should always be accessed through a single mutex
	* mutex scope must be visible to all
	* globally order locks/unlocks
		* for all threads, lock mutexes in order
	* always unlock a mutex
		* always unlock the *correct* mutex

## PThread Condition Variables

![](../assets/content_images/omscs/gios/p2l3_img12.png)
* Condition variable safety tips
	* do not forget to notify waiting threads
		* predicate change => signal/broadcast *correct* condition variable
	* when in doubt which to use, use broadcast instead of signal
		* safer, but will cause performance loss
	* You do not need a mutex to signal/broadcast
		* may be better to move signal/broadcast out of mutex block sometimes.  See example from P2L2
