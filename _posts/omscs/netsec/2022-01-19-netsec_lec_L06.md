# Web Session Management
## Sessions
* Session is a sequence of requests and responses from one browser to one (or more) sites
	* Session can be long (e.g. Gmail) or short
	* Without session management, users would constantly re-authenticate
* Session management: authorize user once; all subsequent requests are tied to user

## Use Session Tokens

 ### Storing Session Tokens
 * Browser cookie:
	 * Set-Cookie: SessionToken=loremipsum
	 * Problem is that a browser can send cookie with every request, even when it's not valid.  Gives rise to CSRF attacks.
 * Embed in all URL links:
	 * `https://site.com/checkout?SessionToken=loremipsum`
	 * If application is not secure or user posts a link somewhere, can leak tokens
 * In a hidden form field
 	* `<input type="hidden" name="sessionid" value="loremipsum"`
 	* Downside is that every user action must result in submission of a form or you lose the token
* Best method is a combination of all 3
	* Browser cookie, embed in URL, hidden form field

## HTTP Referer Header
* Shows the page you are coming from - your referer
* Problem
	* Referer leaks URL session token to 3rd parties
* Solution: referer suppression
	* Referer header not sent when HTTP site refers to an HTTP site in HTML5
		* `a rel="noreferrer" href=www.example.com`

## Session token Security - Logout Procedure
* Web sites must provide alogout function
* Let user login as a different user
* Prevent others from abusing content
* What happens during logout?
	* Delete SessionToken from client
	* Mark session token as expired on server
	* Problem: Many websites do the first but not the second
		* Especially risky for sites who fall back to HTTP after login

## Session Token Quiz
* The token must be stored somewhere
	* True
* Tokens expire, but there should still be mechanisms to revoke them if necessary
	* True
* Token size, like cookie size, is not a conern
	* False

## Session Hijacking
* A major threat in web security.
* Attacker waits for user to login, then sniffs the packets and steals the session token

### Beware of predictable tokens
* Example 1: Incremented Counter
	* User logs in, gets counter value, can increment to view sessions of other users
* Example 2: Weak MAC token
	* Weak MAC exposes secret key from a few cookies, gets counter value, can view sessions of other users
	* Weak crypto bad
* There are APIs and libraries for doing this properly

### Session Token Theft
* Even if a token is randomly generated, still risk in having a live token stolen
* Example 1: Login over HTTPS, but subsequent HTTP
	* Enables cookie theft at wireless cafe (e.g. Firesheep)
	* Other ways network attacher can steal token:
		* Token sent over HTTP
		* Man in the middle attacks on SSL
* Example 2: Cross Site Scripting exploits
	* Amplified by poor logout procedures
		* Logout *must* invalidate token on server
* Mitigations
	* Binding SessionToken to client's computer
		* A common idea: embed machine specific data in sessionID
			* Don't use IDs that can change, like userAgent or IP.  Frankly, there really isn't a good value to use.
			* Better to just use random token

### Session Fixation Attacks
* Suppose attacker can set the user's session toke
	* For URL token, trick user into clicking URL
	* For cookie tokens, set using XSS exploits
* Example:
	* Attacker gets anonymous session token for site.com
	* Sends URL to user with attacker's session token
	* User clicks on URL and logs into site.com
		* This elevates attacker's token to logged-in token
	* Attacker uses elevated token to hijack user's session
*  Mitigation
	*  When elevating user from anonymous to logged-in always issue a new session token
		*  After login, token changes to value unknown to attacker.  Attacker's token is not elevated.

## Session Hijacking Quiz
* Active session hijacking involves disconnecting the user from the server once that user is logged on.  Social engineering is required to perform this type of hijacking
	* True
* In passive session hijacking the attacker silently captures the credentials of a user.  Social engineering is required to perform this type of hijacking
	* False
	* Social engineering is not required

## Summary
* Always assume cookie data retrieved from client is adversarial
* Session tokens are split across multiple client state mechanisms
	* Cookies, hidden form fields, URL parameters
	* Cookies by themselves are insecure (CSRF, cookie overwrite)
	* Session tokens must be unpredictable and resist theft
* Ensure logout invalidates session on server
