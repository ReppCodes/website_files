# Advanced Malware Analysis

## Malware Prevalence
* "Safe" websites not safe to visit
	* Reading USAToday.com may result in malware on your computer
	* How?
		* USAToday's network may be compromised
		* Malicious scripts may be bundled with ads or content, and may redirect the user's browser to download malicious software
* Case study: Alexa top sites
	*  Ranked list of all domains - 252 milliion
	* Top 25k of these were examined each day, systematically
	* Network traffic was monitored for drive-by download
	* 39 of these domains resulted in drive-by downloads
		* 87% of these sites involved exploits for Java
		* 46% of sites served exploits via ad networks
	* 7.8 million users were served malicious content
		* 1.2 million likely compromised
* New features are a regular basis for attacks
	* PDF contains embedded, malicious Flash movie which exploits Acrobat Reader's flash interpreter, thus compromising the system.  This can then phone home to controller
		* Phone home traffic can be observed
	* Soon after, compromised, legitimate websites found hosting drive-by attacks that use the same flaw to exploit Flash player
	* Vulnerability traded back to bug reported to Adobe eight months prior
* Users remain uninformed (vulnerable)
* Example: Waledac's email campaigns
	* Use of geo-location, temporally relevant events (e.g. bomb blast in \<your city\>, July 4th fireworks videos) to make attacks more compelling

## Malware Evolution
* Traditional defense-in-depth
* Network-level protection
	* Firewall
		* evaded by C&C protocol congruency
	* IPS/IDS
		* Evaded by custom encodings
* Host-level protection
	* User Access Control
		* analagous to "informed consent"
			* users usually don't really get it, just click "yes" to get on with their job
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L10_img1.png)
* Antivirus
	* Uses complex, heuristics-based detection along with signature matching

## Malware Obfuscation
### Malware Obfuscation Quiz
* Code that reverses the pre-runtime transformation is included in the executable
	* True
* Each instance looks different, but there is a signature or pattern across all instances
	* False
* A signature scanner that tries to identify malware by its unique strings would not be effective
	* True

### Packing
* **Definition of Packing:** A technique whereby parts or all of an executable file are compressed, encrypted, or transformed in some fashion

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L10_img2.png)
* Transformed code looks random, because it is encrypted with a randomly generated key.
	* This happens each time the packing tool is invoked, so even different copies of the same malware look different
	* Transformed machine code looks like data, so network IDS looking for executables will miss it
* Server Side Polymorphism
	* Attacks the heart of the traditional host-based AV model by automating mutations
* Eventually researches can deobfuscate any malware and discover its behaviors, but it can be a substantial obstacle and takes time
	* Attackers can thwart this by sending updates to compromised computers with newly obfuscated malware, with new behaviors.  This effectively resets the research to square one each time
* Example: Waledac
	* Collected on 12/30/2008
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L10_img3.png)
		* By 2/25/2009 90% of AV can detect it
	* New sample, collected on 2/5/2009
		* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L10_img4.png)
		* Only about 28% of AV can detect this new version
* Impact on Antivirus Software
	* Researchers surveyed McAfee AV using 200,000 malware samples collected over 6 months
		* 53% detected on first day
		* 32% detected with delay (avg delay was 54 days)
		* 15% still not detected 6 months later

### Obfuscation Quiz 2
**Given the following obfuscation techniques, who is the software hiding from?**
* Rootkits
	* Users
* Thoroughly mapping security sites and honey pots so as to avoid them
	* Security
* Using nonce-based encryption methods
	* Researchers

## Malware Analysis
* Understanding malware behaviors
	* Network and host level detection/blocking
	* Forensics and asset remedation
	* Threat/trend analysis
* Malware authors make analysis very challenging
	* Increasingly sophisticated techniques
* A core challenge is that the sheer volume of malware samples is difficult to keep up with, due to automation
	* DIY kits, packing tools, server-side polymorphism vastly increase the volume of samples
	* There are hundreds of thousands of new instances each day
		* Collected from crawlers, mail filters, honeypots, user submissions, and malware exchanges
	* Given that the enemy is automated, analysis must be as well
* The malware uncertainty principle
	* Observer affecting the observed environment
	* Malware may alter its behavior if observation is detected
	* Robust and detailed analyzers are typically invasive
		* In-memory presence
		* Hooks
		* CPU Emulation
	* Malware may refuse to run entirely
	* This is already commercialized
		* Dynamic analyzer detection is a standard malware feature
* We need malware analysis to be transparent to the malware.  Malware must not be able to detect that it is being analyzed
	* Higher privilege for analysis tool than the malware has
	* Must have no non-privileged side effects that might be detected
	* Malware should get the same instruction execution semantics, exception handling, and notion of time as it would if the analyzer were not present
* Most existing tools fall short of the above transparency reqquirements
	* In-guest tools (runs on same machine with same privilege as malware)
		* No higher privilege
		* Non-privileged side effects
		* Exception handling issues
	* Reduced Privilege Guests (VMWare, etc)
		* Non-privileged side effects
	* Emulation (QEMU, Simics)
		* No identical instruction execution semantics
		* These are the most widely used by state of the art analyzers but they have major shortcomings
			* There have been attacks that detect full system emulator approaches by exploiting incomplete emulation
			* There is no way to guarantee the absence of such attacks
			* Determining whether the languages of two Turing machines (L and L') are equal is known as the undecidable problem EQ<sub>TM</sub>
* Example of same instruction semantics attack
	* `0xf30xf3...0x90`
		* 15 `0xf3`s before `0x90`: execute no-op 15 times
		* But the instruction (16 bytes) is illegal because max x86 instruction length is 15 bytes
			* In bare metal, "illegal instruction" excetpion
			* Emulator will happily execute this
* Most challenging transparency requirement is the "identical notion of time"
	* Network-based timing measurements
		* e.g. Analyzer causes delay in requests, or the website the malware tries to connect to is not the real one
		* Impossible to identify all
		* Equivalent to the problem of detecting and removing all covert channels
			* This is proved to be an undecidable problem

## Analysis Difficulty Quiz
**Rank the four categories from easiest (1) to hardest (4)**
* Static Properties Analysis: examine the static properties of the malware.  Static properties include: metadata, strings embeddedi n the malware, header details, etc
	* 2
* Manual Code  Reversing: use a disassembler and decompiler to recreate the malware code
	* 4
* Fully Automated Analysis: use fully automated tools to analyze the malware
	* 1
* Interactive Behavior Analysis: running the mlaware in a protected and isolated environment
	* 3

## Analysis Technique Results Quiz
**Rank the four categories from the most information is obtained (1) to least information is obtained (4)**
* Static Properties Analysis: examine the static properties of the malware.  Static properties include: metadata, strings embeddedi n the malware, header details, etc
	* 3
* Manual Code  Reversing: use a disassembler and decompiler to recreate the malware code
	*1
* Fully Automated Analysis: use fully automated tools to analyze the malware
	* 4
* Interactive Behavior Analysis: running the mlaware in a protected and isolated environment
	* 2

## Robust and Efficient Malware Analysis
* Robust == transparent.  not easily detected or evaded
* Efficient == automated and fast
* Focus on host-based analysis.  Run malware on a machine and observe its behaviors and properties
	* Malware will try to detect the presence of the analyzer, via differences in analysis environment
	* Our goal to achieve identical execution, such that the analyzer cannot be detected
* Formal requirements
	* Higher privilege
		* Analyzer has to have higher privilege over malware
	* No non-privileged side-effects
		* Minimal side-effects should be introduced by the analyzer
		* Analyzer should enforce privileged access to side-effects
	* Identical basic instruction execution semantics
		* Hardware semantics and emulation
	* Transparent exception handling
		* Exception handling should be transparent or same
	* Identical measure of time
		* Timing for each instruction
		* Timing for I/O, exception handling

## Ether Malware Analyzer
* Built at Georgia Tech! And it's open-source!
* Higher Privilege
	* Built using Intel VT (Hardware Virtualization)
	* Hypervisor has higher privilege over kernel
	* Several hardware supported traps -- VM exits
* No non-privileged side-effects
	* Analyzer is outside environment
	* Minimal side-effects.  Trap flag, system call handling
* Identical basic instruction execution semantics
	* Uses hardware virtualization
	* Instruction execution semantics are the same
* Transparent exception handling
	* Hypervisor pre-empts before OS exception handling
* Identical measure of time
	* RDTSC (RealDateTimeStampCounter instruction)
	* Privileged instruction.  Hypervisor can control responses to malware whenever the malware tries to get a measure of time

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L10_img5.png)
* Ether has a Hypervisor component in Xen, and also runs in a separate VM.
* Ether provides both a fine-grained instruction-by-instruction examination of the malware, as well as a more coarse-grained systemcall-by-systemcall examination
* EtherUnpack: extracts hidden code from obfuscated malware
	* Georgia Tech researchers compared how well current tools extract hidden code by obfuscating a test binary and looking for a known string in the extracted code
* EtherTrace: Records system calls executed by obfuscated malware
	* Georgia Tech researchers obfuscated a test binary which executes a set of known operations, and then observe if they were logged by the tool

### Analysis vs Obfuscations
* Analysis: Static Analysis based approaches
	* Obfuscations: Polymorphism, metamorphism, packing, opaque predicates, anti-disassembly
* Analysis: Dynamic malware analysis (running the malware)
	* Obfuscations: Trigger-based behavior (logic bombs, time bombs, anti-debugging, anti-emulation, etc)
* Analysis: Dynamic multipath exploration (Bitscope, EXE, Forced Execution)
	* Obfuscation: ??
		* Battle continues

## Malware Emulators
* Recent move towards emulator-based obfuscation
	* An instruction-level obfuscation approach
	* Several commercial pakcers support emulator based obfuscation, including Code Virtualizer and VMProtect
	* Emulation techniques maturing, widespread adoption is possible

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L10_img7.png)
### Impacts on Existing Malware Analysis
* Unknown language L
	* L can be randomly generated
* Pure Static Analysis (whitebox)
	* Completely thwarted
	* Only emulator code is analyzable
	* P<sub>L</sub> is considered as data by the analyzer
* Greybox methods (dynamic analysis)
	* Includes instruction level analyzers, information-flow, dynamic tainting, multi-path exploration, etc
	* Analysis is inaccurate
	* For example, paths may be explored in the emulator, but not on the malware
* Manual reverse-engineering methods cannot scale
	* Manual reverse-engineering takes time
	* Each malware instance can have new bytecode language and emulator, making reverse-engineered information obsolete
* Need automated techniques to reverse emulator
	* Should not require any knowledge about bytecode
	* Should be generic and work for a large class of emulators
* Is automated reverse engineering possible?
	* Theoretically, it is an undecidable problem
	* However, from intuition, the emulator's fetch-decode-execute behavior can be identified at runtime

### Approaches of Emulation
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L10_img8.png)

### Challenges of Reverse Engineering
* No knowledge of bytecode program
	* The location of the bytecode program in the obfuscated program's memory is not known
* No knowledge of emulator's code
	* The code that corresponds to decode, dispatch, and execute phases of the emulator is not known
* Intentional variations
	* Context can be maintained in many different ways
	* An attacker may complicate Virtual Program Counter (VPC) identification by maintaining it in different correlated variables
	* Bytecode program may be stored in non-contiguous memory

### Approach Overview
* Abstract Variable Binding
	* Identify pointer variables within raw memory of emulator using access patterns of memory reads and writes
	* It is a combination and forward and backward data-flow analysis
* Identify Candidate VPCs
	* Cluster memory reads according to their bound variables
	* Each cluster provides a candidate VPC
* Identify Emulator Phases
	* Identify decode-dispatch loop and emulator phases
* Extract bytecode Syntax and Semantics
	* Identify fetched instruction syntax -- opcode and operands
	* Identify execute routine related to instruction -- this is the semantics of bytecode instruction
	* This information is subsequently used to generate control flow graphs (CFGs)

### Experimental Evaluation
* Researchers created a synthetic program, used two emulation obfuscators (VMProtect and CodeVirtualizer) and applied an implementation of the above approach
* They then compared the CFG of the original program to the CFG of the deobfuscated results
