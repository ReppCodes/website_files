# Property-Preserving Encryption - Oblivious RAM
* Going to continue focus on the cloud, and discuss challenges of data privacy protection

## How Do Data Breaches Happen?
* In a cloud environment, users interact with data in applications stored in cloud infrastructure
	* e.g. Doctors/Nurses accessing patient medical data on a hosted EMR system
* Data is often the most valuable target to an attacker
* How can we protect the data?
	* Encryption!
* Challenge, though, is that the applications can't use encrypted data, so they must also have a key to it.  How to get both protection and usability?

## Encryption Quiz
* Computations performed on encrypted data matches the result of the computation on the plaintext
	* Homomorphic
* Encrypted data is in the same order as the plaintext
	* Property Preserving
* A secret key that allows someone to learn the function that is being encrypted
	* Functional
* Several parties can compute a function using inputs that are kept private
	* Secure Computation
* Encyrpted data that can be searched using encrypted keywords
	* Searchable

## Property Preserving Encryption (PPE)
* PPE is widely deployed
* PPE is Popular because:
	* Deployability
		* No change to application and database servers is needed
	* Expressiveness
		* Supports most common SQL queries
	* Efficiency
		* ~25% overhead
	* Security
		* Mixed bag.  We will discuss further

## PPE Leak Quiz One
* Standard Encryption
	* Leaks nothing except size of input

## PPE Leakage
* What does this leakage mean for real applications?
* Renders data susceptible to inference attacks if stolen
* Example given is encrypted private medical information, when combined with plaintext public information, can be used to infer PHI/PII

## Attacks on Equality-Preserving Encryption
### Frequency Analysis Attack

### â„“<sub>p</sub>-Optimization Attack
* Minimize a cost function that measures the difference between encrypted and auxiliary histogram

### Case Study
* In case study with medical records, this approach was very effective
* Sex of 100% of the patients for 95% of hospitals studied was decrypted
* Mortality Risk of 100% of the patients for 99% of hospitals studied was decrypted
* Major Diagnostic Category of 40% of the patients for 28% of hospitals studied was decrypted
* Death of 100% of the patients for 100% of hospitals studied was decrypted
* Age of 10% of the patients for 85% of hospitals studied was decrypted
* Length of Stay of 83% of the patients for 50% of hospitals studied was decrypted

## Attacks on Order-Preserving Encryption
### Cumulative Attack
* Linear Sum Assignment Problem
* Takes O(n<sup>3</sup>) time using Hungarian Algorithm
* Cumulative attack exploits both order and frequency

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L13_img5.png)
* Basically, by combining order and frequency, the attacker can tell for each ciphertext `c` what proportion of values are less than `c`
	* Leverages Cumulative Distribution Function of encrypted data to better match encrypted values to plaintext values

### Case Study
* In case study with medical records, this approach was very effective
* Length of Stay of 100% of the patients for 100% of hospitals studied was decrypted
* Age of 83% of the patients for 99% of hospitals studied was decrypted

## Oblivious RAM (ORAM)
* Suppose we don't trust our cloud provider
* We could encrypt our data on the cloud storage server, and retrieve+decrypt it whenever we want to use it
* That still  leaks the access pattern of how we use that data
* Oblivious RAM
	* Obliviousness
		* For any fixed size request sequence, the associated storage accesses observed (by the cloud)  are statistically independent of the requests
	* Techniques
		* Operates on fixed size data blocks
		* Encrypt blocks with ciphertext indistinguishability
		* Dummy accesses, re-encryption, shuffling, etc
* Some  ORAM Systems
	* Tree-based: PathORAM
	* Layered-based: LayeredORAM
	* Large messages-based: PractialOS
	* Partition-based: ObliviStore

## ORAM Quiz
* Client must have a private source of randomness
	* True
* Data does not have to be encrypted, since there is no access pattern
	* False
* Each access to the remote storage must have aread and a write
	* True
