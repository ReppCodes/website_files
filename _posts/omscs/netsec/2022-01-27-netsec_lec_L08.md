# Security of Internet Protocols

## Internet Infrasturcture
* Easiest to think of the Internet as a collection of large networks
	* Autonomous Systems (ASs)
* Managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
* Computers within one network use local and inter-domain routing
* Computers across networks use TCP/IP for routing and messaging
	* BGP for routing announcements
	* DNS for finding IP addresses from symbolic names

## Infrastructure Quiz
* A network that purchases all transit from other networks
	* Tier Three
* A network that peers some of its network access and purchases some of it
	* Tier Two
* A network that can reach every other network through peering
	* Tier One

### Trivia
* There are only 17 Tier 1 Networks in the world at the time of recording

## TCP Protocol Stack

* Link Layer is the group of protocols that only operate on the link the host is physically connected to

### Data Formats

## Internet Protocol
#### IP Functions
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L08_img4.png)
* Connectionless
	* Unreliable, best effort only.  No guarantee there
	* Ports are not in IP header because they're part of the transport layer
* Typical route uses several hops
	* No ordering or delivery gaurantees across or between these hops
* Routing
	* IP host knows location of router (gateway)
	* IP gateway must know route to other networks
* Fragmentation and reassembly
	* If max-packet-size less than the user-data-size
* Error reporting
	* ICMP packet sent to source if packet is dropped
* TTL field: decremented after every hop
	* Packet dropped if TTL = 0
	* Prevents infinite loops / routing loops

### IP Quiz
* IP is a connectionless and reliable protocol
* IP provides only best effort delivery.  It is not guaranteed
	* True
* Due to the connectiopnless nature of IP, data corruption, packet loss, duplication, and out-of-order delivery can occur
	* True

### IP Authentication
* Client is trusted to embed correct source IP
	* Easy to override using raw sockets
	* Libnet: a library for formatting raw packets with arbitrary IP headers
* Problem: No Source IP authentication
	* Anyone who owns their machine can send packets with arbitrary source IP, and a response will be sent back to forged source IP
	* Enables anonymous DoS attacks
	* Enables anonymous infection/malware attacks

## Transmission Control Protocol
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L08_img5.png)
* Connection-oriented, preserves order
* Sender breaks data into packets
	* Attach packet numbers
* Receiver acknowledges receipt
	* Lost packets are resent
	* Reassemble packets in correct order
* TCP headers include port numbers

### Yet another coverage of TCP handshake
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L08_img6.png)
* received packets with SN too far out of window are dropped


### TCP Basic Security Problesm
* Network packets pass by untrusted hosts
	* Eavesdropping, packet sniffing
	* Especially easy when attacker controls a machine close to the victim (e.g. WiFi routers)
* TCP state easily obtained by eavesdropping
	* Enables spoofing and session hijacking
* Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities
	* See DDOS Lesson (L02)

### TCP Security Quiz
* Application layer controls can protect application data, and IP addresses
* IP information cannot be protected by transport layer controls
	* True
* Network layer controls can protect the data within the packets as well as the IP information for each packet
	* True
* Data link controls can protect connections comrpised of multiple links

### Random Initial Sequence Numbers
* In TCP handshake, the first packet from client and server have their sequence number randomly generated
* This matters because if those numbers were predictable, an attacker could create a TCP session on behalf of a forged source IP address
* Breaks IP- ased authentication (e.g. SPF, `/etc/hosts`)
	* Random sequence numbers do not prevent this attack, but they make it harder

### Example DoS Vulnerability: Reset
* Attacker sends a Reset packet on an open socker
* If correct SNs then connection will close, denying service to the spoofed victim
	* Naively, probability of success is 1/232 (32-bit seq #s), but many systems allow for a large window of acceptable sequence numbers.  This gives a much higher success probability
* Attcker an just flood with RST packets until one works

## Protocols Quiz
* Protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems
	* Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
	* Handles routing between AS's
* Protocol designed to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol
	* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
	* Handles discovering IP addresses for MAC addresses, using MAC broadcast.
		* Requests from gateway to LAN as MAC broadcast
		* Response from hosts on LAN to gateway with their IP addresses, thus binding the IP address to their MAC address
* Protocol uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior routing protocols
	* Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
	* Handles routing within AS's

## Routing Security: Interdomain Routing
* Autonomous System: Connected group of one or more Internet Protocol preficxes under a single routing policy (aka domain)
* Within-AS routing is handled by OSPF
* Between-AS routing is handled by BGP

### ARP Security
* ARP is a broadcast protocol
* Local network attacks
	* Node A can confuse a gateway into sending it traffic intended for Node B just by responding with whatever IP address it wants to impersonate
	* This grants Node A man in the middle status, and it can proxy traffic to Node B, reading/injecting whatever it wants

### BGP Security
* Unauthenticated route updates
	* Anyone can cause entire Internet to send traffic for a victim IP to attacker's address
		* Notorious example is the Pakistani attack on Youtube
	* Anyone can inject advertisements for arbitrary routes
	* Advertisement will propagate everywhere
	* Used for DoS, spam, and eavesdropping (details in DDoS lecture L02)

### BGP Attacks Quiz
* Unmasking the AS relationships by hacking the routing table
	* Revelation of network topologies
* Not yet used by hackers because damage cannot be contained.  It can blowback to the attacker
	* Creating route instabilities
* The first step is to hijack traffic from a legitimate host
	* Routing to endpoints in malicious networks
* Create a false route or kill a legitimate one
	* Denial of Service
* The attacker must control a device along the victim's communication path
	* Sniffing

### BGP Security Solutions
* RPKI: AS obtains a certificate (rout origination authority -- ROA) from regional authority (RIR) and attaches ROA to path advertisement
	* Advertisements without a valid ROA are ignored
	* Defends against a malicious AS (but not a network attacker)
* SBGP: sign every hop of a path advertisement

## S-BGP Design Overview
* IPSec: secure point-to-point router communication
* Public Key Infrastructure: authorization for all S-BGP entities
* Attestations: digitally-signed authorizations
	* Address: authorization to advertise specified address blocks
	* Route: Validation of UPDATEs based on a new path attribute, using PKI certificates and attestations
* Repositories for distribution of certificates, CRLs, and address attestations
* Tools for ISPs to manage address attestations, process certificates and CRLs, etc.

### Address Attestation
* Indicates that the final AS listed in the UPDATE is authorized by the owner of those address blocks
* Includes identification of:
	* owner's certificate
	* AS to be advertising the address blocks
	* address blocks
	* expiration date
* Digitally signed by owner of the address blocks
* Used to protect BGP from erroneous UPDATEs
	* authenticated but misbehaving or misconfigured BGP speakers

### Route Attestation
* Indicates that the speaker or its AS authorizes the listener's AS to use the route in the UPDATE
* Includes identification of:
	* AS's or BGP speaker's certificate issued by owner of the AS
	* the address blocks and the list of AS's in the UPDATE
	* the neighbor
	* expiration date
* Digitally signed by owner of the AS (or BGP speaker) distributing the UPDATE, traceable to the IANA
* Used to protect BGP from erroneous UPDATEs
	* authenticated but misbehaving or misconfigured BGP speakers
* To validate a route from ASn,  ASn+1 needs:
	* address attestation from each organization owning an address block(s) in the NLRI
	* address allocation certificate from each organization owning address blocks in the NLRI
	* route attestation from every AS along the path (AS1 to ASn), where the route attestation for ASk specifies the NLRI and the path up to that point (AS1 through ASk-1)
	* certificates for each AS or router along path (AS1 to ASn) to check signatures on the route attestations
	* all the relevant CRLs must have been checked
