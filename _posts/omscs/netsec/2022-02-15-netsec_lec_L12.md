# Cloud Computing - VM Monitoring
* Definition of cloud computing: a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction
* Note: the cloud computing industry represents a large ecoystem of many models, vendors, and market niches.  This definition attempts to encompass all of thevarious cloud approaches

## Cloud Characteristics Quiz

## Virtualization Quiz
Virtualizaiton requires at least **one** instance(s) of an application or resource that is to be shared by different organizations.
Sharing between organizations is accomplished by assigning a **logical name** to the resource and then giving each request a **pointer** to the resource

## Virtualization Quiz 2
Virtualization involves creating a virtual machine using **existing hardware** and **operating systems**.  The virtual machine is **logically isolated** from the host hardware.

## Virtualization Quiz 3

## Platform Virtualization
* The most important technology for cloud computing is virtualization
* Cloud computing relies on separating your applications from the underlying infrastructure -- Steve Herrod, CTO at VMware
* Key is the "hypervisor" or "virtual machine monitor"
	* Enables guest OSs to run in isolation of other OSs
	* Run multiple types of OSs
* Increases utilization of physical servers
* Enables portability of virtual servers between physical servers
* Increases security of physical host server

## Kernel-Level Attacks and Security Tools
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img3.png)
* Kernel has higher privilege than userland, so it can detect malware running at user-level
	* If the attack is at kernel level, this protection is lost

### Hypervisor Based Approaches
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img4.png)
* Hypervisor has higher privilege than guest kernel
* Security VM is separated from User VM
* Introspection is used to access contents of user VM
* Active monitoring places hooks and invokes security monitor

## VirtualBox Security Quiz
**Which of the following steps is considered safe when working with virtual machines?**
* Set the clipboard sharing between the VM and the host to bidirectional
	* False
* Allow the VM to read and write files on the host machine with the same privileges as the host machine
	* False
* Disconnect the VM from the internet when opening files
	* True

## Monitoring Memory
* One of the most essential tasks of VM security is memory analysis
* The only reliable source of the current state of a computer system is memory
* Nearly endless data for security, forensics, etc
	* Running and (some) killed processes
	* Encryption keys and decrypted data
	* Network sockets and data
	* OS-level accounting information
	* User input (e.g. key strokes, mouse movement)
	* Screen captures and graphical elements
	* And much more

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img5.png)
* Passive monitoring: Viewing memory in A<sub>n</sub> from S without any timing synchronization between the two virtual machines
* Active monitoring: Viewing memory in  A<sub>n</sub> from S with event notification being sent from  A<sub>n</sub> to S to permit monitoring at relevant times
* Locating valuable data: find critical data structures within the raw memory view for the monitoring task
	* e.g. finding the process list

### Passive Monitoring
* Monitoring application periodically views memory from another virtual machine
	* Technique known as VM introspection
* Address and symbol mapping can be performed by a VM introspection library
	* e.g. libVMI 
	* Convert pointer addressed into something useful

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img6.png)

### Understanding Memory Contents -- libVMI
* when reading raw memory, it's literally just 1s and 0s.  
	* Need to understand the abstraction layers on top of this
* libVMI previously called XenAccess
	* started at Georgia Tech!
* Open source VM intropsection library
* Access to virutal addresses, kernel symmbols, and more
* Released in Spring 2006

#### libVMI Features
* Read and write VM memory
* Virtual memory translation
	* Using various methods (DTB, PTD, kernel symbol)
* Find and map guest OS data structures
* Place monitoring event-hooks into the guest
	* Exceptions, page faults, etc
	* Pause guest and transfer conrol to callback function (hook)
	* Hookable events:
		* Memory r/w/x events on defined regions
		* Register r/w events CR0/CR3/CR4/MSR registers
		* Interrupt events
	* Single step through instructions

### Active Monitoring
* Event Driven
	* Enforcing security policy
	* Preventing attacks

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img7.png)

#### Active Monitoring Challenges
* High overhead
	* Invocation cost:
		* Requires switching to hypervisor when security tool is invoked
		* Especially for fine-grained monitoring
	* Introspection Cost:
		* Accessing untrusted VM memory requires calls to hypervisor for mapping pages to security VM

## Secure In-VM Monitoring (SIM)
* Can we have the best of both worlds?  Security of out-of-VM monitoring with efficiency and performance of in-VM monitoring?
	* Yes!  Georgia Tech has developed SIM approach
* Bringing security to traditional in-VM approaches
* Addresses security and performance requirements together
	* Same security as out-of-VM approaches
	* Performance close to traditional in-VM approaches
* Utilize hardware virtualization features
	* No hyperfisor intervention during monitor invocation
	* Untrusted VM reads/writes are at native speed

### Requirements of SIM
* Fast invocation
	* Invocation of monitor happens without any privilege changes
* Data read/write at native speed
	* Native instructions should be able to read/write data directly
* Isolation of monitor code and data
* Secure invocation for event-handling
* Monitor's execution does not rely on untrusted code and data

### SIM Design
* Security requiremnt: Isolation
	* Achieved by using separate paged virtual addresses
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img8.png)
* Performance requirement: Fast invocation
	* Achieved by having no hypervisor intervention
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img9.png)
	* Modify CR3 register contents directly using Intel VT
	* Use Intel intrinsic "Last Branch Record" in invocation checker.  With last branch record, we know the last several instructions leading to the entry gate
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L12_img10.png)

### SIM Monitor Invocation Overhead
* Micro benchmarking
	* Measure time required between executing hook and returning back from SIM monitor
	* Use null handlers, so that only switching time is measured
	* SIM Approach
		* Avg time: 0.469 microseconds
		* Std. Dev: 0.051 microseconds
	* Out-of-VM Approach
		* Avg time: 5.055 microseconds
		* Std. Dev: 0.132 microseconds
