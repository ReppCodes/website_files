# Penetration Testing

- First line of network defense

## Overview

- Test to evaluate strengths of all security controls
    - Procedural
    - Operational
    - Technological
- Benefits
    - Security of network
    - Discovery of vulnerabilities
    - Demonstration of threats
- Scope
    - Can include social engineering, physical access (in addition to traditional cyber)
- Scale
    - Security of entire network

## Methodology

- Footprinting
    - whois, nslookup
- Scanning
    - nmap, fping
- Enumeration
    - dumpACL, showmount legion, rpcinfo
- Gaining access
    - tcpdump, Lophtcrack NAT
- Excalating privilege
    - Johntheripper, getadmin
- Pilfering (exfiltration)
    - rhosts, user data, config files, registry
- Covering tracks
    - zap, rootkits
- Creating back doors (persistence)
    - cron, at, startup folder netcat, keystroke logger, remote desktop

## Footprinting

- Reconnaissance and information gathering
- Find out target IP address/phone number range
- Namespace acquisition
- Network Topology (visualRoute)
- Essential to a "surgical" attack
- Techniques -- Tools
    - Open Source search -- Google, search engine, Edgar
    - Find domain name, admin, IP addresses, name servers -- whois (network solution; arin)
    - DNS zone transfer -- nslookup (ls -d), dig, Sam Spade

## Scanning

- Which machine is upand what ports are open
- Which services are running
- Their versions and configurations
- Look up corresponding vulnerability info on the web
- Focus on most promising avenues of entry
- Reduce frequency of scanning and randomize the ports or IP addresses to be scanned in the sequence
- Techniques -- Tools
    - Ping sweep -- Fping, icmpenum, WS_Ping Propack, nmap
    - TCP/UDP port scan -- nmap, superscan, fscan
    - OS detection -- nmap, queso, siphon

## Enumeration

- Identify valid user accounts or poorly protected resource shares
- More intrusive probing than scanning step
- Techniques -- Tools
    - List user accounts -- Null sessions, dumpACL, sid2usre, onSiteAdmin
    - List file shares -- showmount, NAT, legion
    - Identify applications -- banner grabbing with telnet or netcat, rpcinfo

## Gaining Access

- Identify a vulnerability of the target from scanning
- Exploit it
    - often with existing tool/script. may need modifications
- In general, automatically generating a working exploit from a new vulnerability is still an open problem
- Techniques -- tools
    - Password eavesdropping -- tcpdump/ssldump, L0phtcrack, readsmb
    - File share brute forcing -- NAT, legion
    - Password file grap -- tftp, pweddump2
    - Buffer overflow -- ttdb, bind, IIS, .HTR/ISM.DLL

## Escalating Privilege

- If only user-level access was obtained in the last step, seek to gain complete control of the system
- Techniques -- tools
    - Password cracking -- John the ripper, L0phtcrack
    - Known Exploits -- Lc_messages, getadmin, sechole

## Pilfering (Exfiltration)

- Gather info to allow access of trusted systems
- Techniques -- tools
    - Evaluate trusts -- rhosts, LSA secrets
    - Search for cleartext passwords -- User data, Configuration files, registry

## Covering Tracks

- Once total ownership of the target is secured, hiding this fact from system administrators become paramount, lest they quickly end the romp
- Techniques -- tools
    - Clear logs -- Zap, Event Log GUI
    - Hide tools -- Rootkits, file streaming

## Creating Back Doors (Persistence)

- Trap doors will be laid in various parts of the system to ensure that privilege access is easily regained wheneve the intruder decides
- Techniques -- tools
    - Create rogue user accounts -- Members of wheel, admin
    - Schedule batch jobs -- cron, at
    - Infect startup files -- rc, startup folder, registry keys
    - Plant remote control services -- netcat, remote.exe, VNC, B02K, remote desktop
    - Install monitoring mechanisms -- Keystroke loggers, add acct. to secadmin mail aliases
    - Replace apps with Trojans -- Login, fpnwcint.dll

## Penetration Testing Quiz

- Which events should trigger a penetration test?
    - Infrastructure is added or modified
    - Applications are added or modified
    - End user policies are changed
    - Security patches are installed

## Persistence and Stealth

- To simulate an APT, the above attributes are needed
- Installation of backdoor or malware
    - A permanent foothold
- Insertion of proxies or man-in-the-middle systems, or simply "listening/recording"
- Capture credentials and identify valuable target
    - Impersonation and data thefts

## Social Engineering

- Users are the weakest link in security
- Use "social engineering" attack techniques to evaluate user population
    - Identify vulnerable user groups
    - Identify policy gaps
    - Fix policies and mechanisms, including user education and training
- Why is social engineering effective?
    - Manipulates legitimate users into undermining their own security system
    - Abuses trusted relationships between employees
    - Very cheap for the attacker
    - Attacker does not need specialized equipment or skills

## RSA Breach Quiz

- List the steps attackers used to access RSA's Adobe Flash software:
    - Identify employees that are vulnerable
    - Craft an email subject line that entices an employee to open it
    - Hide an executable file in the email that will install onto the victim's computer when the email is opened
- In 2011, RSA was compromised
    - Social engineering was used to penetrate the company's defenses
    - Once in, the attackers installed a backdoor using an Adobe Flash vulnerability
    - Total damage estimated at $66million

## Common Social Engineering Techniques

- Impersonation
    - Help Desk

            - Trojan horse downloads install surveillance programs
    - Email Attachments
        - Attacker tricks user into downloading malicious software
        - Programs can be hidden in downloads that appear legitimate
        - Examples:
            - Executable macros embedded in PDF files
            - Camouflaged extension: "NormalFile.doc" vs "NormalFile.doc.exe"
    - Email Scams
        - More prevalent over time
        - Begins by requesting basic information
        - Leads to financial scams

        - Spread using social engineering techniques
        - Productivity and resource cost
    - Websites
        - Offer prized but require a created login
        - Attacker capitalizes on users reusing login credentials
        - Website credentials can then be used for illegitimate access to assets
