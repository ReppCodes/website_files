# HTTPS
* HTTPS: Hyper Text Protocol Secure = all communication between your browser and a website is encrypted
* Basically HTTP over SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
	* SSL now called TLS (Transport Layer Security)
* As opposed  to HTTP, which is a clear text protocol
* Creates a secure channel over an insecure network
* Is reasonable protection against man in them iddle attacks
* Can still provide security even when only one side of the communication is secure

## Why is HTTPS not used for all web traffic?
* Crypto slows down web servers (but not by much if done right)
* Some ad networks do not support HTTPS 
	* Reduced ad revenue for publishers
	* Stats given are from 2015, probably way out of date

## HTTPS Quiz
* Select all of the items that can be encrypted by HTTPS
	* Request URL
		* True
	* Query parameters
		* True
	* Headers
		* True
	* Cookies
		* True
	* Host addresses
	* Port numbers
	* The amount of transferred data
	* Length of the session

## HTTPS Threat Model: Network Attacker
* Controls network infrastructure: Routers, DNS
* Eavesdrops, injects, blocks, and modifies packets
* Examples:
	* Wireless network at internet cafe
	* Internet access at hotels (untrusted ISP)

## SSL/TLS Overview
* Uses public key crypto

### Certificate Authority
* Key challenge is how does Alice obtain Bob's public key?
	* Standard is to use certificates issued by an authority

### Certificates on the Web
	* Subject's commonName can be:
		* An explicit name, e.g. cc.gatech.edu
		* A wildcard cert, e.g. \*.gatech.edu
	* Matching Rule:
		* \* must occur in leftmost component, does not match "."
		* For example: "\*.a.com" matches "x.a.com" but not "y.x.a.com"
* Browsers accept certificates from a large number of CAs
	* Top level CAs ~ 60
	* Intermediate CAs ~ 1200
* Browser handshake

## HTTPS In the Browser: The Lock Icon
* Intended Goal:
	* Provide the user with identity of page origin
	* Indicate to user that page contents were not viewed or modified by a network attacker
* Indicates that all elements on the page were fetched using HTTPS
* For all elements:
	* HTTPS cert issued bya CA trusted by the browser
	* HTTPS cert is valid (not expired)
	* Domain in URL matches:
		* CommonName or SubjectAlternativeName in cert

## HTTPS Disadvantages Quiz
* Which of the following are real disadvantages to using HTTPS
	* Browser caching won't work properly
	* You need to buy an SSL certificate
		* True
		* Outdated, thanks LetsEncrypt
	* Mixed modes issue - loading insecure content on a secure site
		* True
	* HTTPS uses a lot of serverr esources
	* Proxy caching problems - public caching cannot occur
		* True
	* HTTTPS introduces latencies

## Problems with HTTPS and the Lock Icon
* Upgrade from HTTPS to HTTPS
	* SSL stripping attack prevents browser from upgrading, but won't display any certificate errors
		* aka HTTP downgrading attack
		* Solution is to use HSTS (Strict Transport Security)
			* Policy set for max of 1 year, on server
			* Header tells browser to always connect over HTTPS
			* Subsequent visits must be over HTTPS (self signed certs result in an error)
				* Browser refuses to connect over HTTP or if self-signed cert, requires that entire site be served over HTTPS
			* HSTS flag deleted when users "clears private data": a tradeoff between security and privacy
* Forged certificates
	* Wrong issuance
	* DigiNotar example
	* Many other examples
	* Breaks the whole cert trust model
	* Functions like a man in the middle attack

## Solutions to Certificate Issues
* Dynamic HTTP public-key pinning
	* Let a site declare CAs that can sign its sert (similar to HSTS)
	* On subsequent HTTPS visits, browser rejects certs issued by other CAs
	* TOFU: Trust On First Use
	* There's an HPKP extension (HTTP header from server) to facilitate this
* Certificate Transparency
	* Idea: CAs must advertise a public log of all certs they issued
	* Browser will only use a cert if it is published on log server
		* Efficient implementation using Merkle hash trees
	* Companies can scan logs to look for invalid issuance
