# Introduction
## What are CPS's
* Cyber-physical systems are the integration of computing and physical domains
	* usually done to improve reliability and performance

## Parts of a CPS
* Generation system
	* where electrons are first generated using whatever source
* Then push into transmission system
	* transmission system is basically a wheelbarrow
* Ends in distribution system
	* step down in voltage, and leaves from there to a home

## Key Equipment
* Transformer
	* steps voltage up or down as needed
* Circuit breaker
	* sits ahead of transformer and protects and other components downline
* Recloser
	* protects the circuit feeding your home, similar to a circuit breaker

## Compromise
* If a component is compromised, biggest problem locally is outages
* Bigger problem is destabilization of grid, causing much larger outages
