# Cybercrimes

## Actors in the Underground

- Exploit developers
    - very smart people who reverse-engineer software
    - develop and sell exploit packs and kits
- Botnet masters
    - Develop software and control vast numbers of zombie machines
    - Rent out their botnet to other actors
- Spammers
    - Advertise links for other actors
- Phishers
    - Setup scam sites to steal information
    - Work with spammers to spread the attack
- Counterfeiters
    - Run websites selling fake goods
    - Must be able to clear credit cards
- Bulletproof Hosting Provides
    - Offer dedicated servers to other actors
    - Hosted in lawless parts of the internet
- Carders, Cashiers, and Mules
    - Turn stolen bank accounts and credit cards into cash
- Crowdturfers
    - Create, verify, and manage fake accounts
    - Solve CAPTCHAS for a fee

## Structure of the Underground

- Pay-per-install and Exploit-as-a-service --> Botnets {Credit Card and Bank Account Theft | DDoS and Ransomware Extortion | Click Fraud and Ad Injection | Spam | Bitcoin Mining}
    - Spam can facilitate Phishing, Counterfeit Goods, and Malware Attachments
    - Credit Card and Bank Account Theft can facilitate Carders and Cashiers
- The general point is that bad actors form an interconnected ecosystem

## Underground Forums

- One of the entry points into the ecosystem
- Today, underground forums are ubiquitous
    - Many operate in plain site; they're just a Google search away
    - Large volume of illicit goods and services are available
- Law enforcement often targets forums/IRC rooms
    - In some cases, forums have been law enforcement sting operations
- Black market forums are hugely valuable for security professionals
    - Give researchers a view into the underworld
    - Allow white-hats to observe trends and detect unfolding attacks
- Forums are populated by buyers, sellers, and rippers
    - Administrators verify trustworthy buyers
    - Rippers steal from naive buyers or sell fraudulent goods
    - Some participants ask for goods or services

## Exploits-as-a-Service: Decoupling and Specialization

- In the old days, compromise and monetization were coupled
    - Criminals would develop exploits, use them to launch attacks, and then use the hacked machines to make money
- Monetization and Compromise are decoupled
    - Exploit developers sell exploit kits or packs
    - Other actors leverage the kits to attack hosts
    - Often via spam and/or compromised web servers
    - Compromised hosts are then sold on the black market

### Pay-per-install model of malware

- A malware distribution model
    - Relies on drive-by-download attacks against browsers
    - Blackhole, MPack, and other exploit kits
- Two styles of attacks
    - A bad actor can buy an exploit kit and deploy it themselves
        - Bad actor must figure out distribution themselves. Need infrastructure.
    - A bad actor can rent access to an exploit server that hosts that kit
        - Azure metasploit, lol
- Bad actors are responsible for acquiring traffic

## Dark Web Quiz

- Readily available to the public, and searchable with standard search engines
    - Surface web
    - While this is what we're typically referring to when we talk about "the internet", it really makes up only about 4% of the WWW content. About 96% is deep web
- It is not indexed by standard search engines
    - Deep web
- Web content that exists on darknets
    - Dark web

## PPI Quiz

- A program that hides malicious code from anti-virus software
    - Crypters
- Software that allows an attacker to update or install malware on a victim's computer
    - Trojan Download Manager
- It increases traffic to the attacker's site by manipulating search engines
    - Blackhat Search Engine Optimizer
- A webpage that lists many keywords, in hopes of increasing search engine ranking. Scripts on the page redirect to the attackers page
    - Doorway pages

## From Malware to Botnets

- Infected machines have many other valuable resources
    - Unique IP addresses and bandwidth
    - Spare CPU cycles
- Botnets allow criminals to aggregate and control infected machines
    - Command and Control (C&C, C2) infrastructure for controlling bots
    - Swaths of bots are often rented out to other actors for various purposes

## Command and Control: IRC Channels

- The key to a botnet's success is efficient and robust C2
- This is not always easy
- Simplest and most efficient approach is through centralized control
    - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L03_img2.png)
    - Problem: single point of failure
    - Easy to locate and take down
- A more robust approach is to use a peer-to-peer network
    - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L03_img3.png)
    - The drawback is that the botmaster does not have direct control over, or communication with, all the bots
        - In fact, the botmaster may not know how many bots even get the commands, or when
- A more modern Approach is Fast Flux DNS
    - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L03_img4.png)
    - All bots connect to a C2 website
    - Website can map to whatever IP address, easy to post up wherever. This defeats IP-address-based blocking
    - However, domain name can still be detected and blocked
- Most modern approach is Random Domain Generation
    - Takes Fast Flux DNS approach, but generataes random domain names using same algorithm and seed between bot and botmaster

## Spam Quiz

- What are the two defining characteristics of spam?
    - Inappropriate or irrelevant to the user
    - Large number of recipients

## Spam

- It is estimated that >90% of all email sent each day is spam
    - This translates into hundreds of billions of spam messages per day
- Spammers are key players in the cybercrime underground
    - Build, curate, buy, and sell lists of email addresses
    - Send mail on behalf of other actors for a fee
        - Traffic-PPI services looking to acquire traffic and infections
        - Phishers looking to steal personal information
- Spammers rent access to botnets to send bulk email
    - Need a large number of IP addresses to circumvent spam filters

### Spam Affiliate Marketing

- Huge amounts of spam are related to affiliate marketing schemes
    - Scammers set up websites selling counterfeit goods
- Scammers are responsible for delivering products and collecting payments
    - Access to credit card processing infrastructure is crucial
    - Many scams have legitimate customer service departments!
- Spammers sign up as "affiliates" with scam campaigns
    - Spammers advertise the scams, and collect commision on successful sales
    - Commission is typically 30-50% of the final sale price

### Spam Conversion

- The conversion rate is the percent of spam messages that result in a final sale
- Big questions
    - Why do spammers continue to send spam?
    - How many messages get past spam filters?
    - How much money does each successful transaction make?
- Measurement technique -- infiltrate the spam generation/monetizing process and find out answers

### Spam Filter Effectiveness

- A case study (Storm botnet)
    - What percentage of spam got through the filters?
    - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L03_img6.png)
    - Average: 0.014% -- 1 in 7,142 attempted spams got through
    - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L03_img7.png)
    - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L03_img8.png)
        - Conversion rates (on messages that made it to inbox):
            - Pharmacy = 1 in 1,737
            - Postcard = 1 in 37
            - April Fool = 1 in 25
        - Revenue from pharmacy:
            - Extrapolates to $9,500/day (and 8,500 new bot infections per day), or $3.5million per year
            - This is split between the affiliate program and the Storm operators (60/40 split)

## Spam Revenue Quiz

- Name the top three countries where spam directed visitors added items to their shopping cart.
    - USA
    - Canada
    - Philippines

## Scamming Ain't Easy

- The scamming ecosystem
    - Network infrastructure and the key role of payment processors
- What sort of hosting infra do you need to run such a scam?

### Infra

- Domain Name (s)
    - Problem - Legit registrars will take down your name if they receive complaints
    - Solution - Some registrars are known to ignore complaints, but they carge more.
- DNS Servers
    - Problem - DNS Servers are an obvious choke-point for Law Enforcement
    - Solution - "Bulletproof" DNS is available on the market, but its expensive
- Web Servers
    - Problem - Web servers are an obvious choke-pointg for Law Enforcement
    - Solution - "Bulletproof" servers are available, but they're expensive
- Some services offer resilient hosting with distributed web servers, domain randomization, and DNS fast-flux
    - But obviously, it's expensive!

### Payments

- To sell products, you need to be able to accept payments
- You'll need:
    - Merchant bank account to deposit your payments
    - Relationship with a payment processing service
        - Handles credit card payments
        - Withdraws money from the buyers account via a card association network (e.g. Visa)
- Downfall: most banks and processors won't do business with scammers
- Solution: Again, go to "bulletproof" vendors and eat expensive fees
