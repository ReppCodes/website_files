1. Modifies back-end statement through user input
	* Injection
2. Inserts Javascript into trusted sites
	* Cross site scripting
3. Program flaws allow bypass of authentication methods
	* Broken Authentication and Session
4. Attackers modify file names
	* Insecure Direct Object References
5. Abuses lack of data encryption
	* Sensitive data exposure
6. Exploits misconfigured servers
	* Security misconfiguration
7. Privilege functionality is hidden rather than enforced through access controls
	* Missing Function Level Acces Control
8. Uses unpatched third-party components
	* Using components with known vulnerabilities

## Goals of Web Security
* Browse the web safely
	* No stolen information
	* Site A cannot compromise session at Site B
* Support secure web applications
	* Applications delivered over the web should be able to achieve the same security properties as standalone applications

## Web Security Threat Model vs Network Security Threat Model
* Web security threat model:
	* Attacker sets up a malicious site
	* Attacker does not control the network
* Network security threat model:
	* Attacker intercepts and controls network
	* Can be much more active

## Attack Top 10 Quiz
1. Injection
2. Broken Authentication and Session
3. Cross Site Scripting
4. Insecure Direct Object References
5. Security MIsconfiguration
6. Sensitive Data Exposure
7. Missing Function Level Access Control
8. Cross Site Request Forgery
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

## Web Threat Models
 * Web Attacker
	 * Control attacker.com
	 * Can obtain SSL/TLS certificate for attacker.com
	 * User visits attacker.com
	 	* Or: runs attacker's app, etc.
	* Typically passive.  Set up infra and wait for users
* Network Attacker
	* More powerful
	* Can perform passive actions, such as wireless eavesdropping
	* Or active actions, such as an "evil" router, or DNS poisoning
		* Attacker changes the DNS entries for legimitate sites to redirect to malicious servers
* Malware Attacker
	* Most general and powerful attack
	* Attacker escapes browser isolation mechanisms and runs separately under control of OS
	* Browsers may contain exploitable bugs
		* Often enable remote code execution by web sites
	* Even if browsers were bug-free, still lots of vulnerabilities on the web
		* XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc.

## Modern websites
* Typical website contains both static and active contents
* Active contents can be from many sources and combined in many ways
* Acting parties on a website can include:
	*  Page developers
	*  Library developers
	*  Service providers
	*  Data providers
	*  Ad providers
	*  Other users
	*  Extension developers
	*  CDN
*  Basic security questions:
	*  Protecting sensitive informataion in browser
	*  Ensuring some form of integrity
	*  How do we protect page from ads/services?
	*  How to share data with cross-origin pages?
	*  How to protect one user from another's content?
	*  How do we protect the page from a library?
	*  How do we protect page from CDN?
	*  How do we protect extension from page?

## Website Quiz
* In 2015 how many active websites were on the internet?
	* 1 billion
* How many websites does Google quarantine each day?
	* 10,000
* How many malicious websites are identified each day?
	* 30,000

## Browsers
### Browsers vs Operating Systems
* Primitives
	* Operating System
		* System calls
		* Processes
		* Disk
	* Web Browser
		* Document Object model
		* Frames
		* Cookie/local storage
* Principles
	* Operating System
		* Users
		* Discretionary Access Control
	* Web Browser
		* Origins
		* Mandatory Access Control
* Vulnerabilities
	* Operating System
		* Buffer Overflow
		* Root Exploit
	* Web Browser
		* Cross-site scripting
		* Cross-site request forgery
		* Cache history attacks

### Basic Execution Model
* Each browser window or frame:
	1. Loads Content
	2. Renders
		* Processes HTML and scripts to display the page.  May involve images, subframes, etc
	3. Responds to events
		* User actions: onClick, onMouseover
		* Rendering: onLoad, onUnload
		* Timing: setTimeout, clearTimeout
* Browser content comes from many sources and these can interact with each other

### Sandbox
* Goal: safely execute JavaScript code provided by a remote website.  No direct file access, limited access to OS, network, browser data, content that came from other websites
* Same Origin Policy (SOP): Can only read properties of documents and windows from the same protocol, domain, and port
* User can grant privileges to signed scripts:
	* UniversalBrowserRead/Write, UniversalFileRead, UniversalSendMail

## Sandbox Quiz
* **For each characteristic, put an S for Sandbox, V for virtual machine, or B for both**
* Anything changed or created is not visible beyond its boundaries
	* B
* If data is not saved, it is lost when the application closes
	* S
* It is a machine within a machine
	* V
* Lightweight and easy to set up
	* S
* Disk space must be allocated to the application
	* V

## Browser Same Origin Policy
* URL: `protocol://domain:port/path?params`
* Origin is defined as protocol, domain, and port
* Same Origin Policy (SOP) for DOM:
	* Origin A can access origin B's DOM if A and B have same protocol+domain+port
* Same Origin Policy for cookies:
	* Generally, based on protocol+domain+path
	* protocol is optional

## Frame Security
* Windows may contain frames from different sources
* Frame and iFrame are like "mini browser windows"
* Frame: rigid division as part of frameset
* iFrame: floating inline frame
* Why use frames?
	* Can display webpage within a frame
	* Frames provide a natural separation of different web contents
	* Delegate scren area to content from another source
	* Browser provides isolation based on frames
	* Parent window may work even if frame is broken
* Should be able to achieve the same level of isolation whether we use two separate browser windows, or a frame within a window
* Apply the Same Origin Policy to achieve frame security
	* Each frame of a page has an origin (`protocol://host:port`)
	* Frame can access its own origin
		* Network access
		* Read/write DOM
		* Storage (cookies)
	* Frame cannot access data associated with a different origin
* Frame-Frame Relationships
	* `canScript(A,B)`
		* Can Frame A execute a script that manipulates arbitrary/nontrivial DOM elements of Frame B?
	* `canNavigate(A,B)`
		* Can Frame A change the origin of content for Frame B?
* Frame-Principal Relationships
	* `readCookie(A,S)` and `writeCookie(A,S)`
		* Can Frame A read/write cookies from site S?

## Browsing Context
* A frame with its DOM
* A web worker (thread), which does not have a DOM
	* Javascript executed from an HTML page that runs in the background independently of other user interface scripts that may also have been executed from the same HTML page
* Every browsing context:
	* Has an origin, determined by protocol, host, port
	* Is isolated from others by same-origin policy
	* May communicate to others using postMessage
	* Can make network requests using XHR or tags
		* XHR is used for sending http/s requests and load the results from a web server
	* Many similarities between a browsing context and an OS process
* Modern Structuring Mechanisms
	* HTML5 iframe Sandbox: Load with unique origin, limited privileges
		* Directives
			* Sandbox
				* Ensures iframe has unique origin and cannot execute JavaScript, no form submission, disable API's, prevent content from using plugins, etc
			* allow-scripts
				* Ensures iframe has unique origin
			* allow-forms
				* allows form submission
			* allow-popups
				* allows popups
			* allow-pointer-lock
				* allows pointer lock (mouse moves)
			* allow-same-origin
				* allows the document to maintain its origin.  pages loaded from origin will retain access to that origin's data
			* allow-scripts
				* allows JavaScript execution, and also allows features to trigger automatically (as they'd be trivial to imiplement via JavaScript)
			* allow-top-navigation
				* allows the document to break out of the frame by navigating the top-level window
	* Content Security Policy (CSP): Whitelist instructing browser to only execute or render resources crom specific sources
		* Goal: Prevent andl imit damage of XSS
			* XSS attacks bypass the same origin policy by tricking a site into delivering malicious code along with intended content
		* Approach: restrict resource loading to a whitelist
			* Prohibits inline scripts embedded in script tags, inline event handlers and javascript, URLs
			* Disable JavaScript eval(), new Function (), etc.
			* Content-Security-Policy HTTP header allows site to create whitelist, instructs the browser to only execute or render resources from those sources
		* Directives
			* script-src
				* limits the origins for loading scripts
			* connect-src
				* limits the origins to which you can connect (via XHR, WebSockets, and EventSource)
			* font-src
				* specifies the origins that can serve web fonts
			* frame-src
				* lists origins that can be embedded as frames
			* img-src
				* lists origins from which images can beloaded
			* media-src
				* restricts the origins for audio and video
			* object-src
				* allows control over Flash, other plugins
			* style-src
				* is script-src counterpart for style sheets
			* default-src
				* define the defaults for any directive not specified
		* Source Lists
			* Specify by scheme, e.g. https
			* Specify by host name, matching any origin on that host
			* Specify by Fully qualified URI
			* Wildcards accepted, only as scheme, port, or in the leftmost position of the hostname
			* 'none' matches nothing
			* 'self' matches the current origin, but not subdomains
			* 'unsafe-inline' allows inline JavaScript and CSS
			* 'unsafe-eval' allows text-to-JavaScript mechanisms like eval()
	* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Relax same-origin restrictions
	* HTML5 Web Workers: Separate thread; isolated but same origin.  Not originally intended for security, but helps
	* SubResource integrity (SRI) 

## CSP Quiz
* If you have third party forum software that has inline script, CSP cannot be used
	* False
* CSP will allow third party widgets (e.g. Google +1 button) to be embedded on your site
	* True
* For a really secure site, start with allowing everything, then restrict once you know which sources will be used on your site
	* False

## Web Worker
* Not originally intended for security, but help security a good deal
* Run in an isolated thread, loaded from a separate file
* Example
```js
var worker = new Worker('task.js');
worker.postMessage(); // start the worker
```
* Has the same origin as the frame that creates it, but no DOM
* Communicate using postMessage

```js
// main thread
var worker = new Worker('doWork.js');
worker.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
	console.log('Worker said: ', e.data);
}, false);
worker.postMessage('Hello World'); // Send data to worker

// doWork
self.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
	self.postMessage(e.data); // Return message it is sent
}, false);
```

## SubResource Integrity (SRI)
* Many pages pull scripts and styles from a wide variety of service and content delivery networks
* How can we protect against:
	* downloading content from a hostile server (via DNS poisoning, or other such means)
	* Modified file on the Content Delivery Network (CDN)
* Idea: page author specifies hash of (sub) resource they are loading; browser checks integrity
	* examples shown in script tag with integrity=SHAHASH
* What happens if the integrity check fails?
	* Case 1 (default)
		* Browser reports violation and does not render/execute resource
	*  Case 2
		*  CSP directive with integrity-policy directive set to report
		*  Browser reports violation, but may render/execute resource

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
* Example given of AWS.com and Amazon.com wanting to share resources, as both are owned by Amazon
* We want the same origin policy still, prevent other sites from corrupting our interactions
* CORS is a techniqque for relaxing the same-origin policy, allowing JavaScript on a web page to consume content from a different origin
* A website whitelists all domains

### How CORS Works
* Browser sends Origin header with XmlHttpRequest request
	* This origin is the parent page, e.g. https://amazon.com
* Server can inspect Origin header and respond with Access-Control-Allow-Origin header

## CORS  Quiz
* CORS allows cross-domain communication from the browser
	* True
* CORS requires coordination between the server and client
	* True
* CORS is not widely supported by browsers
	* False
* The CORS header can be used to secure resources on a website
	* False

## SOP Quiz
* Recall that a same-origin policy requires requests to access data must be from the same origin.  What is the definition of an origin?
	* A combination of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme, hostname, and port nubmer

## SOP and Cookies
* When a browser visits a website, the server sets a cookie for that client
* There are a number of attributes that can be set via cookie
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L05_img1.png)

### Scope Setting Rules
* Domain: any domain-suffix of URL-hostname, except TLD
	* login.site.com can set cookies for all of site.com, but not for another site or TLD
		* Allowed Domains: 
			* login.site.com
			* site.com
		* Disallowed Domains:
			* other.site.com
			* othersite.com
			* .com
* Path can be set to anything within allowed domains

### Settingand DeletingCookies by Server
* Cookies are identified by (name, domain, path)
* Cookie1
	* name = userid
	* value = test
	* domain = login.site.com
	* path = /
	* secure (means it must be https)
* Cookie2
	* name = userid
	* value = test123
	* domain = .site.com
	* path = /
	* non-secure
* Goal is that server only sees cookies in its own scope

### Client-side read/write: document.cookie
* Setting a cookie in Javascript:
	* document.cookie = "name=value; expires...;"
* Reading a cookie:
	* alert(document.cookie) -> prints string containing all ocokies available for document (based on protocol, domain, path)
* HttpOnly cookies: not included in document.cookie and cannot be accessed by client-side scripts

## SOP Security Quiz
* given this website: "http://www.example.com/dir/page.html", determine the outcome (success or failure) for each compared URL.  Check each URL that has the same origin as the given site
* http://www.example.com/dir2/other.html
	* True
* http://www.example.com/dir/page2.html
	* True
* http://username:password@www.example.com/dir2/other.html
	* True
* http://www.example.com:81/dir/other.html
	* False
* http://example.com/dir/other.html
	* False
* https://www.example.com/dir/other.html
	* False

## Cookie Quiz
* A cookie with an origin of a top-level domain
	* Super
* A cookie that is regenerated after it is deleted
	* Zombie
* A cookie that can only be sent in request originating from the same origin as the target domain
	* SameSite
* A cookie that cannot be accessed by client-side APIs
	* HttpOnly
* A cookie that belongs to a domain that is different than the one shown in the address bar
	* Third-party
* An in-memory cookie.  It does not have an expiration date.  It is deleted when the browser is closed
	* Session
* A cookie that has an expiration date or time.  Also called tracking cookies
	* Persistent
* A cookie that can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection
	* Secure


## Cookie Protocol Problems
* The server is blind
	* Does not see cookie attributes (e.g. secure, HttpOnly)
	* Does not see which domain set the cookie
	* Server only sees:
		* Cookie: NAME=VALUE

### Example 1
* Alice logs in at login.site.com, generating a session-id of Alice's session
* Alice visits evil.site.com, overwriting the .site.com cookie with session-id of user Badguy
* Alice visits course.site.com, course.site.com thinks it's interacting with Badguy
* Problem is that course.site.com expects session-id from login.site.com; cannot tell that session-id cookie was overwritten

### Example 2
* Alice logs in at https://accounts.google.com
* That site sets the cookie, with secure flag
* Alice visits http://www.google.com (cleartext)
* Network attacker can inject into response:
	* `Set-Cookie: SSID=badguy; secure`
	* Which will secure and overwrite secure code
* Problem is that a network attacker can intercept and re-write HTTPS cookies!  HTTTPS cookie value cannot be trusted

### Interaction with the DOM SOP
* Path separation is done for efficiency not security
	* x.com/A is only sent the cookies it needs
* Cookie SOP path separation:
	* x.com/A does not see cookies of x.com/B
* Not a security measure because x.com/A still has access to DOM of x.com/B

### Cookies have no integrity
* User can change and delete cookie values
	* Edit cookie database (FireFox: cookies.sqlite)
	* Modify cookie header (FireFox: TamperData extension)

## Cryptographic Checksums
* Goal: data integrity
* Requqires server-side secret key k unknown to browser 
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L05_img2.png)

### Example: ASP.NET
* `System.Web.Configuration.MachineKey`
	* Secret web server key intended for cookie protection
* Creating an encrypted cookie with integrity
	* `HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie(name, val)`
	* `HttpCookie encodedCookie = HttpSecureCookie.Encode(cookie)`
* Decrypting an validating an encrypted cookie
	* `HttpSecureCookie.Decode(cookie)`

## Checksum Quiz
* Cryptographic hash functions that are not one-way are vulnerable to preimage attacks
	* True
* A difficult hash function is one that takes a long time to calculate
	* False
	* Should be hard to analyze, but not to calculate
* A good cryptographic hash function should employ an avalanche effect
	* True
