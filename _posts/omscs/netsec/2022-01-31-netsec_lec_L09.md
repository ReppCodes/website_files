# Domain Name Systems Security
* Hierarchical Name Space (hierarchical database)
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L09_img1.png)
* There are 13 root servers

## DNS Lookup
* An iterative (recursive) process querying the hierarchical database
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L09_img3.png)
* DNS record types (partial list)
	* NS: name server (points to other server)
	* A: address record (contains IP address)
	* MX: address in charge of handling email
	* TXT: generic text (e.g. used to distribute site public keys a la DKIM)

## DNS Caching Quiz
Changing a domain name into an IP address involves a large number of steps.  To save time, the records are **cached** on a local server for reuse later.
Each record has a **TTL** that states how long a record can be kept for future use.

## Caching
* DNS responses are cached
	* Quick response for repeated translations
	* Note: NS records for domains are also caached
* DNS negative queries are cached
	* Save time for nonexistent sites, e.g. misspelling
* Cached data periodically times out
	* Lifetime (TTL) of data controlled by owner of data
	* TTL passed with every record

## Basic DNS Vulnerabilities
* Users/hosts trust the host-address mapping provided by DNS
	* Used as basis for many security policies
		* Broswer same origin policy, URL address
* Obvious problems
	* Interception of requests or compomise of DNS servers can result in incorrect or malicious responses
		* e.g. malicious access point in a cafe
* Solution
	* Authenticated requests/responses
		* Provided by DNSsec, but few use DNSsec yet

### Cache Poisoning
* Basic idea: give DNS servers false records and get it cached
* DNS uses a 16-bit request identifier to pair queries with answers
* Cache may be poisoned when a name server:
	* Disregards identifiers
	* Has predictable ids
	* Accepts unsolicited DNS records

## DNS Quiz
* DNS stores the IP address.  For security reasons the domain name is stored somewhere else
* All domain names and IP addresses are stored at the central Registry
	* True
* It can take several days for information to propagate to all DNS servers
	* True

## DNS Packet
![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L09_img4.png)
* Query ID
	* 16bit random value
	* Links response to query
* Example Request
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L09_img5.png)
* Example Response to Resolver
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L09_img6.png)
* Example Authoritative Response
	* ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L09_img7.png)

## Traditional Poisoning Attack
* Attacker sends a normal DNS query to a local resolver, via a compromised machine (call it A1)
* Eventually this request will recurse down to the authoritative server, which will send a valid response
* In the meantime, attacker will send a forged response with a malicious IP address from a second comrpomised machine (call it A2), racing the real response from the authoritative server
	* Attacker does not know the query ID, so must send a flood of responses with guessed query IDs and hope one lands with the right query ID before the official response does
	* If that happens, the poisoned result will be cached, causing all DNS traffic to point to the malicious IP address until TTL expires
* If this attempt is not successful, the attacker needs to wait for TTL to expre before retrying

## Kaminksy's Poisoning Attack
* RIP Dakami
* General approach is the same as traditional poisoning
* The difference is in the payload.  Traditional approach tries to poison the cached address record, whereas this goes up one level and hijacks the authority records instead
* Goal is to have the DNS server cache the wrong IP address for authoritative service for a random domain (e.g. $RAND.www.google.com)
* Efficiency gain is that attacker doesn't have to wait for TTL to expire, can just pick a different random domain and try again immediately

## DNS Defenses
* Increase Query ID size
* Randomize source port, additional 11 bits
	* Now attack takes several hours
* Ask every DNS query twice
	* Attacker has to guess QueryID correctly twice (32 bits)
	* But DNS system cannot handle the load
* DNS SEC

### DNS SEC
* Guarantees
	* Authenticity of DNS answer origin
	* Integrity of reply
	* Authenticity of denial of existence
* Accomplish this guarantee by signing DNS replies at each step of the way
* Uses public-key cryptography to sign responses
* Typically use trust anchors, entries in the operating system to bootstrap the process
* Example

## DNS Rebinding Attack
* Attacker registers a domain name, say `www.evil.com`
* Attacker sets extremely short TTL for this record
* Attacker sets up malicious JS to execute, and when TTL expires rebinds hostname to an address usually reserved for internal networks, e.g. `192.168.0.100`
* Victim firewall does not properly guard against this "internal" address and so malicious JS traffic is permitted through
* Additionally, browser now views these commands as coming from the same origin, so it will allow the script to access resources it should not

### Defenses
* Browser mitigation: DNS Pinning
	* Refuse to switch to a new IP 
	* This interacts poorly with proxies, VPN, dynamic DNS, and other common mechanisms
	* Thus, this is not consistently implemented in any browser
* Server-side defenses
	* Check host header for unrecognized domains
	* Authenticate users with something other than IP
* Firewall defenses
	* External names can't resolve to internal addresses

## DNS Rebinding Quiz
* The attacker needs to register a domain and delegate it to a server  under his control
	* True
* The attacker's server responds with a short TTL record
	* True
* A short TTL means thee page will be quickly cached
* The attacker exploits the same origin policy
	* True
