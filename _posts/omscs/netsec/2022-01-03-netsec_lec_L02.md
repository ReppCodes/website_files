# DDoS Attacks

- Distributed Denial of Service

## DOS Taxonomy Quiz One

1.  A portion of a list of targets is supplied to a compromised computer
    - Hitlist scanning
2.  All compromised computers share a common psuedo-random permutation of the IP address space
    - Permutation scanning
3.  Uses the communication patterns of the compromised computer to find a new target
    - Signpost scanning
4.  Each compromised computer probes random addresses
    - Random scanning

## DOS Taxonomy Quiz Two

1.  Generate 32-bit numbers and stamp packets with them
    - Random spoofing
2.  Generate random addresses within a given space
    - Subnet spoofing
3.  The spoofed address is the address of the target
    - Fixed spoofing

## DOS Taxonomy Quiz Three

1.  The motivation of this attack is a crucial service of a global internet operation, for example core router
    - Infrastructure
2.  The attack is targeted to a specific application on a server
    - Server application
3.  The attack is used to overlaod or crash the communication mechanism of a network
    - Network Access

## Network DoS

- Goal is to take out a large site with little as little computing power as possible
- How is this accomplished?
    - Amplification
    - Small number of packets to accomplish a big effect
    - Two types
        - DoS bug -- design flaw allowing one machine to disrupt a service
        - DoS flood -- command botnet to generate a flood of requests
- DoS can happen at any layer
    - Example at Link layer
        - just send a lot of traffic to saturate link
    - Example at TCP/UDP transport layer
        - Server needs to use memory to hold state about TCP connections. Run the server OOM with too many such connections
    - Example at application layer
        - attacker can request the application to fetch large amounts of data, exhausting the server's resources
- Sad truth: current internet is not designed to handle DDoS attacks

### Amplification Quiz

- NTP server used to sync time and date. Data volume of request is much smaller than the response.
- In general, any situation where small requests generate large resposnes is vulnerable to amplification attacks
    - A notable case study is open DNS resolvers
- Additionally, UDP is vulnerable to source IP spoofing, meaning that the large response can be aimed at any victim address desired
- It is difficult to ensure computers communicate only with legitimate NTP servers, making filtering difficult

### Amplification Example

- Scale of amplification attacks determined by two factors.
    - Number of bots sending bogus requests
    - Amplification ratio of response/request sizes
- Example given of open DNS resolvers

## IP Header Format

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L02_img1.png)

- IP is connectionless, and unreliable
- Each packet will find its way to destination, but no mechanism to ensure they all do, nor in order. Best effort
- Main weakness of IP from a security perspective is that there's no authentication of the source IP address. This allows spoofing of source addresses

## TCP Header Format

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L02_img2.png)

- Session based
- Destination will check that all packets have arrived and are in order
- Also offers congestion control
- Minimizes packet loss
- SEQ and ACK numbers used for keeping track of order, flags used for state

## TCP Handshake

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L02_img3.png)

## TCP SYN Flood

## Low Rate -- DoS Bug

- In TCP handshake, server needs to keep memory in state while waiting for ack
- Attacker can spoof source IP address, even from single machine
- Fills up backlog queue on server
- No further connections possible
- Example given is blaster worm from 2003
    - Attacked windowsupdate.com, 50 SYN packets per second
    - MS just issued a new name
- Non-solutions:
    - increase backlog queue size or decrease timeout
    - attacker can just send more packets, bad solution
- Correct solution -- syncookies: remove state from server

### SYN Cookies Quiz

1.  SYN cookies require modified versions of TCP
    - FALSE
2.  SYN cookies lead to overall slower performance
    - FALSE
3.  The server must reject all TCP options because the server discards the SYN queue entry
    - TRUE

## Massive Flood -- DDoS

- Command bot army to flood specific target
- 20,000 bots can generate 2Gb/sec of SYNs (2003)
- At web site:
    - Saturates network uplink or network router
    - Random source IP -> attack SYNs look the same as real SYNs
        - Hard to filter
- How do we defend against this?
    - Prolexic/Cloudflare
    - One idea is to use powerful servers to protect a website. These will only forward established TCP connections to site
        - These proxies will handle SYNs and respond with SYN/ACKs
        - When proxy receives ACK, then forward to actual website
        - Attackers will not send ACK, so only normal traffic is serviced
        - This isn't bulletproof
- Attacker can send complete TCP connections, from botnets
    - Send short HTTP HEAD request
    - Repeat
    - All these requests are "legitimate" from a protocol point of view
    - Similar to "real" spikes in traffic volume
    - This will bypass SYN flood protection proxy BUT attacker can no longer use random source IPs
        - This reveals the location of bot zombies
        - The proxy can now block or rate-limit the bots
- Example given of second kind of attack is GitHub DDoS from 2015
    - Involved interesting embedding of malicious html from a popular server
    - The JS instructed the user's computer, once infected, to attack GitHub.com

### Flood Attack Quiz

- Attackers can spoof the IP Address of their UDP packets
    - TRUE
- The attack can be mitigated using firewalls
    - FALSE
- Firewalls cannot stop a flood because the firewall is susceptible to flooding
    - TRUE

## DoS via Route Hijacking

- The IP protocol itself can be used to launch DoS attacks
- Example given below:
    - The gist is that just announcing a more specific prefix will tell the whole internet to send request for an IP address in that range to you instead of the rightful owner

## DoS at Higher Levels

### SSL/TLS Handshake (SD'03)

![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L02_img6.png)

- RSA decrypt is much more expensive than RSA encrypt. The server does way more work on that third leg than the client has to do in total
    - This represents amplification, and so is the basis for a possible attack
- Simply sending fetch requests for very large resources, such as a large .pdf file, can also accomplish DoS in this way.

## DoS Mitigation - Client puzzles

- Goal is to slow down the attacker
- Done by giving them a moderately hard problem
    - e.g. Given challenge C find X such that...
        - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L02_img7.png)
        - Assumption: takes expected 2^n time to solve
        - For n=16 takes about .3sec on 1Ghz machine
    - Main point is that checking the puzzle solution is easy, repairing the disparity in workload between client and server, reducing amplification threat surface
- During DoS attack everyone must submit puzzle solution with requests
- When no attack, do not require puzzle solution
- Examples
    - TCP connection floods (RSA '99):
        - Example challenge `C = TCP server-seq-num`
        - First data packet must contain puzzle solution
            - Otherwise TCP connection is closed
    - SSL handshake DoS (SD'03):
        - Challenge C based on TLS session ID
        - Server: check puzzle solution before even attempting to do the RSA decrypt
    - Similar ideas can be applied to application layer, or payment systems
- Benefits
    - Hardness of challenge can be decided based on DoS attack volume
- Limitations
    - Requires changes to both clients and servers
    - Hurts low power legitimate clients during attack
        - Possibly, clients on cell phones and tablets cannot even connect

## DoS Mitigation - Client Puzzles: Memory-Bound Functions

- CPU power ratio:
    - (high end server)/(low end cell phone) = 8000
    - Impossible to scale to hard puzzles
- Interesting observation:
    - Main memory access time ratio:
        - (high end server)/(low end cell phone) = 2
- Solution requires many main memory accesses
- Reading provided in class notes

### Puzzle Quiz

- Client puzzles should be hard to construct. This is an indication of the level of difficulty to solve them.
    - FALSE
- Client puzzles should be stateless.
    - TRUE
- Puzzle complexity should increase as the strength of the attack increases.
    - TRUE

## DoS Mitigation - CAPTCHAs

- CAPTCHA: Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart
- Idea is to verify that the connection is from a human
- Applies to application layer DDoS
- During attack, generate CAPTCHAs and process request only if valid solution

## DoS Mitigation - Source Identification

- Goal is to identify the packet source
- To block the attack at the source (ingress filtering)
- Harder than it sounds
- ISP is often unable to help
- Problem is it requires ALL ISPs to do this, which requires global trust
- If even 10% of ISPs don't participate, this provides functionally no defense
- There is no incentive for the ISP to participate
- As of 2014
    - 25% of Autonomous Systems are fully spoofable
    - 13% of announced IP address space is spoofable

## DoS Mitigation - Traceback

- Given a set of attack packets, determine path to source
- Done by changing routers to record this information in packets
- Assumptions:
    - Most routers remain uncompromised (so that this information is valid)
    - Attacker sends many packets
    - Route from attacker to victim remains relatively stable
- Simple method
    - Have each router write its own IP address to packet
    - Victim reads path from packet
    - Problems:
        - this requires space in the packet
            - The path can be very long
        - There are no extra fields in the current IP format
            - Changes to packet format are not practical to expect
- Better method
    - DDoS involved many packets on the same path
    - Store one link in each packet
        - Each router probabilistically stores its own address in the packet
        - This results in fixed space regardless of path length

### Traceback Quiz

- Attackers can generate limited types of packets
    - FALSE
- Attackers may work alone or in groups
    - TRUE
- Attackers are not aware of the tracing mechanism
    - FALSE

### Traceback Mechanism -- Edge Sampling

- Main component is the edge sampling algorithm
- Edge is the start and end IP addresses
- Distance is the number of hops since last time edge was stored
- Marking procedure for router R
    - when packet arrives, toss a coin
    - if coin turns up heads (with probability p) then:
        - write R into start address
        - write 0 into distance field
    - if coin turns up tails
        - if distance == 0 then write R into end field
        - increment distance field
- Example
    - Packet received at R1 from source or another router
    - Packet slated to travel through 3 routers, R1, R2, and R3
    - R1 tosses coin, gets heads, chooses to write start of edge
    - R2 tosses coin, gets tails, chooses not to overwrite edge
    - Distance is 0, so R2 writes itself to end address, increments distance to 1
    - R3 tosses coin, gets tails, chooses not to overwrite edge
        - Distance is 1, so it does not write itself as end address, increments distance to 2
- With edge information, we can now reconstruct the packets path
    - Extract information from attack packets
    - Build graph rooted at victim
    - Each (start, end, distance) tuple provides an edge
    - expected number of packets needed to reconstruct path can be probabilistically given by formula:
        - ![img](../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L02_img8.png)

### Edge Sampling Quiz

- Multiple attackers can be identified since edge identifies splits in reverse paths
    - TRUE
- It is difficult for victims to reconstruct a path to the attacker
    - FALSE
- Requires space in the IP packet header
    - TRUE

## Reflector Attack

- Attacker spoofs Victim's IP and sends DNS query to many DNS servers
- All DNS servers respond to the DNS query and send data to victim's IP
- Victim is flooded by all of the data sent from the DNS servers
- Examples
    - DNS Resolvers: UDP 53 with victim.com source
        - At victim: DNS response
    - Web servers: TCP SYN 80 with victim.com source
        - At victim: TCP SYN ACK packet
    - Gnutella servers
- Typically launched by a botmaster, commanding many bots
- Reflectors send streams of non-spoofed but unsolicited traffic to victim
- There is no traceback information kept by the reflectors, to allow the victim to know the sources of the attack

### Reflector Attack Quiz

- Self defense against reflector attacks should incorporate:
- Filtering - filter DNS traffic as close to the victim as possible
    - FALSE
- Server redundancy - servers should be located in multiple networks and locations
    - TRUE
- Traffic limiting - traffic from a name server should be limited to reasonable thresholds
    - TRUE

## Capability-Based Defense (Theoretical)

- A number of examples available, papers linked
- Basic idea is that the receivers can specify what packets they want
- How?
- Sender requests capability in SYN packet
    - Path identifier used to limit number of requests from one source
- Receiver responds with capabiltiy
- Main point is that Routers will only forward request packets, and packets with valid capability
- Capabilities can be revoked if source is attacking
    - Blocks attack packets close to source
