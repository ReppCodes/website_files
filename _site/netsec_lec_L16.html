  <h1 id="domain-and-network-reputation">Domain and Network Reputation</h1>

<h2 id="dnsbl-quiz">DNSBL Quiz</h2>
<p><strong>Match the DNSBL level with its description</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This IP address does not send spam, and should not be blacklisted.  But it is not fully trustworthy
    <ul>
      <li>NoBL</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This IP address is not directly involved in spamming but is associated with spam-like behaviors
    <ul>
      <li>Grey</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No trust in this IP address
    <ul>
      <li>Black</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Complete trust in this IP address
    <ul>
      <li>White</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="motivation-for-reputation">Motivation for Reputation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Traditionally, if an IP address was discovered to  have sent spam, it was added to a blocklist.  This is known as a “static” blocklist</li>
  <li>Problem with that is that new IP address are trusted, and spammers know to get new addresses periodically</li>
  <li>Instead of innocent until proven guilty, the reality of the situation demands a “suspect until proven innocent” model</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-blocklist-model-criteria">New Blocklist Model Criteria</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Motivation
    <ul>
      <li>Static DNSBL increasingly ineffective</li>
      <li>Need a dynamic, comprehensive reputation system that outputs reputations scores for domains</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Intuitions
    <ul>
      <li>Legitimate uses of domains/sites are different from malicious uses, and the differences can be observed in DNS query traffic</li>
      <li>Patterns/reputation of Requesters, Resolved IPs, Network providers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Approach
    <ul>
      <li>Extract temporal and statistical features from DNS traffic, compute/learn models</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dns-quiz">DNS Quiz</h2>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L16_img3.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h3 id="kopis-statistical-features">Kopis Statistical Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Requester Diversity (RDI)
    <ul>
      <li>Characterize if the machines (e.g. RDNS servers) that query a given domain name are localized or are globally distributed (based on BGP prefixes, AS numbers, country codes, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Requester Profile (RP)
    <ul>
      <li>Distinguish between requesters located in ISP/small business and home networks</li>
      <li>Assign a higher weight to RDNS servers that serve a large client population because a larger network would have a larger number of infected machines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

      <li>Whether, and to what extent, the IP address space pointed to by a given domain has been historically linked with known malicious activities, or known legitimate services</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dynamic-detection-quiz">Dynamic Detection Quiz</h3>

</ul>

<h2 id="study-of-mobile-malware-prevalence">Study of Mobile Malware Prevalence</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Motivation
    <ul>
      <li>Much work on mobile malware has been on analysis of (malicious) mobile apps</li>
      <li>But, how prevalent are infections on mobile devices?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Intuitions
    <ul>
      <li>The malicious mobile web is a part of the malicious web</li>
      <li>Mobile malware uses similar infrastructure (C&amp;C) techniques as non-mobile/Internet malware</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Approach
    <ul>
      <li>Obtain DNS traffic in cellular network and identify domains looked up by mobile apps</li>
      <li>Analyze information related to the Internet hosts pointed to by these domains</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-data-and-findings">Key Data and Findings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Three months of data from a major US cellular provider and a major US non-cellular ISP</li>
  <li>Known mobile malware samples remain rare in US
    <ul>
      <li>Only 6,858 out of 380,537,128 devices, or 0.002%
        <ul>
          <li>This seems like a dated statistic</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>iOS vs Android and other devices
    <ul>
      <li>equally likely to connect to suspicious domains</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First identify mobile devices, then attribute each DNS query to a device.  Then analyze reputation of RRs associated with DNS query
    <ul>
      <li>Use NOTOS features to analyze the hosting infrastructures of the mobile domains.  Just using different features.</li>
      <li>Obtain the host IPs pointed to by the mobile domains. For each IP, extract statistical features of:
        <ul>
          <li>Related historic non-cellular domains</li>
          <li>Related historic mobile domains</li>
          <li>Malware association</li>
          <li>URLs for phishing and drive-by download</li>
          <li>Blacklisting incidents</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="botnet-takedown-quiz">Botnet Takedown Quiz</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One of the more successful methods to taking down a botnet requires investigators to find and target each bot in the net
    <ul>
      <li>False</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A proven method to stop botnets requires isolating the C&amp;C domain from the botnet
    <ul>
      <li>True</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With regards to takedowns, P2P-based networks are much easier than C&amp;C networks
    <ul>
      <li>False</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="botnet-takedowns">Botnet Takedowns</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Takedowns are ad-hoc, of arguable success, are performed without oversight</li>
  <li>System goal: add rhyme+reason to takedowns
    <ul>
      <li>evaluate previous takedown attempts</li>
      <li>recommend and inform on future takedowns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>High-level idea: push our knowledge of infrastructure towards completeness
    <ul>
      <li>Network-side: passive DNS</li>
      <li>Malware-side: malware backup infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overview of RZA system for assessing botnet takedown:
    <ul>
      <li><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L16_img6.png" alt="img" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>RZA interrogates malware by catching domain requests and returning “no such domain” responses, prompting malware to try backup domains if it has them.  This populates the list of malware domains for the model
    <ul>
      <li>This may also prompt malware to switch to P2P behavior, if it is able, which is valuable to know about</li>
      <li>In general, if malware is presented with unavailable infrastructure:
        <ul>
          <li>Retries hardcoded IPs/domains</li>
          <li>Tries to reach a finite set of IPs/domains OR</li>
          <li>Tres to reach an increasing number of IPs/domains (DGA/P2P)
            <ul>
              <li>DGA == Domain Generation Algorithm</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Manipulate fundamental protocol packets to convince malware its primary network asset is unavailable
        <ul>
          <li>DNS and TCP</li>
          <li>Easy to add additional protocols</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ideal takedown flow:
    <ul>
      <li><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L16_img7.png" alt="img" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rza-takedown-study">RZA Takedown Study</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Of the 45 active botnets reviewed:
    <ul>
      <li>2 had DGA-based backup mechanisms</li>
      <li>1 had P2P -based backup mechanisms</li>
      <li>42 were susceptible to DNS-only takedown</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Conclusion drawn by researchers is to advocate for a central authority to coordinate and oversee takedowns
    <ul>
      <li>ICANN’s UDRP/URS as example frameworks
        <ul>
          <li>Criteria for takedowns</li>
          <li>More eyes == more successes</li>
          <li>Test with new TLDs (much like with URS)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
