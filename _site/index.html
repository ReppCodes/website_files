<p>Hi, my name is Andrew. This is my personal website, where I house articles about my pet projects, class notes, miscellaneous ramblings, and whatever else I feel like.  All opinions expressed here are my own and not representative of my employer or affiliates.  Enjoy your stay, I hope you find something to interest you!</p>

<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3>
<p>I’m a computer nerd with a variety of interests.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I currently work as a Software Engineer at VMware, working on the Greenplum Kernel R&amp;D Team.  Greenplum is a fork of PostgreSQL, redesigned to specialize in distributed, petabyte-scale OLAP use cases. My specific areas of responsibility are backup/restore and the core server code.  I work with <code class="highlighter-rouge">go</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>, and I love it.</li>
  <li>My previous gig was at a cybersecurity startup, mostly focusing on the backend parsers and inference engines. I mostly used Python, Redis, Docker, and <strong>lots</strong> of regex.</li>
  <li>Prior to working in software I worked as a data scientist in the healthcare space, for about 7 years. I wrote a lot of SAS and Python, across several different areas.</li>
  <li>I completed my MSCS at Georgia Tech in Fall 2022. I specialized in Computing Systems, with a good amount of infosec coursework mixed in. I’m incredibly proud to have been part of that institution.</li>
</ul>
