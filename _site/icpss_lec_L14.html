  <h2>ICPSS Lecture Notes - Lesson 14 - Threats to CPS in Other Domains</h2>
  <h1 id="threats-to-cps-in-other-domains">Threats to CPS in Other Domains</h1>
<h2 id="health-care-and-medicine">Health Care and Medicine</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For our purposes, these domains consist of:
    <ul>
      <li>Monitoring health conditions of the patients and taking necessary actions</li>
      <li>Technologies related to home care, assisted living, smart operating rooms, smart medical devices, and smart prescriptions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security-and-privacy-in-implantable-medical-devices">Security and Privacy in Implantable Medical Devices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In 2001, the estimated number of patients in the United States with an iimplantable medical device (IMD) exceeded 25 million</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-study">Example Study</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A 2008 study analyzed the security and privacy properties on an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
    <ul>
      <li>This model of ICD includes pacemaker technology and is designed to communicate wirelessly with a nearby external programmer in the 175kh frequency range</li>
      <li>The security and privacy properties of a common ICD were assessed and attacks on privacy, integrity, and availability were conducted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is an ICD?
    <ul>
      <li>An ICD is a device that monitors and responds to heart activity</li>
      <li>ICDs have modes for pacing, wherein the device periodically sends a small electrical stimulus to the heart, and for defibrillation, wherein the device sends a larger shock to restore normal heart rhythm</li>
      <li>A physician surgically implants the ICD below the patient’s clavicle and close to the skin.  The physician also implants electrical leads that connect the ICD to the heart muscle</li>
      <li>Post-surgery, a health care practitioner can use an external programmer to perform diagnostics, read and write private data, and adjust therapy settings</li>
      <li>A malfunctioning or maliciously configured ICD could harm a patient in multiple ways</li>
      <li>Inside the ICD is a magnetic switch.  A magnetic field in proximity to this switch causes it to close, which in turn causes the ICD to wirelessly transmit telemetry data, including electrocardiogram (EKG) readings</li>
      <li>The ICD wirelessly communicates with the external programmer using the 175kHz band, which is intended for short-range communications</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The researchers reverse-engineered the communication protocol for the ICD, and implemented several software-radio-based attacks
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple impacts demonstrated.  Basically a fish in a barrel scenario.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="intelligent-transportation">Intelligent Transportation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Medium/large scale</li>
  <li>Improving safety, coordination, and services in traffic management and real-time info sharing</li>
  <li>Many benefits to both efficiency and safety</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attacking-vehicle-advanced-driver-assistance-systems">Attacking Vehicle Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 2016, researchers presented a study demonstrating attacks against these systems</li>
  <li>To minimize accidents and improve the driving experience, various advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been created</li>
  <li>Attacks on ADAS are emerging</li>
  <li>Attacks utilize the underlying principals of sensors to blind or deceive them, e.g. exploiting the active probing mechanisms that are used to detect barriers
    <ul>
      <li>Vehicle ADAS tricked into believing objects in the vehicle’s way are no longer there, or tricked to make obstacles appear</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vehicle-sensors">Vehicle Sensors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ultrasonic sensors
    <ul>
      <li>Proximity – 2m</li>
      <li>Proximity sensors that aim at detecting barriers within several meters from a car body.  They are mainly designed for low speed scenarios, e.g. parking assistance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Forward-looking cameras
    <ul>
      <li>Short Range – 30m</li>
      <li>Used for lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, and backward cameras for parking assistance.  Short-range Millimiter-wave (MMW) radars (Short-range radar, SRR) serve for blind spot detection and cross traffic alert</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>LiDAR and medium-range MMW radars (Medium-range radar, MRR)
    <ul>
      <li>Medium Range – 80-160m</li>
      <li>Operate in medium range and assist collision avoidance and pedestrian detection</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Long-range MMW radars (Long-range radar, LRR)
    <ul>
      <li>Long Range – 250m</li>
      <li>Designed for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) at high speeds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-required-for-sensor-attacks">What is Required for Sensor Attacks?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sensors relying on distinctive physical principles require different equipment</li>
  <li>Ultrasound transceivers used in exploit against ultrasonic sensors</li>
  <li>Radio frequency (RF) transceivers used in exploit against MMW radars</li>
  <li>Lasers used in exploit against cameras</li>
  <li>No physical contact with the targeted sensors, thus the attacks were “contactless”
<img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L14_img1.png" alt="img" /></li>
  <li>This study launched both “spoofing” and “jamming” attacks
    <ul>
      <li>Spoofing attacks involved emitting carefully crafted signals similar to the real signals transmitted to the sensors normally.  Thus the sensors interpreted the spoofed signals as real ones, and responded accordingly.</li>
      <li>Jamming attacks involved a very strong signal, which interfered with the real ones.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
