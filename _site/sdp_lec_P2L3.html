  <h2>Software Dev Process Lecture Notes - Part 2 Lesson 3 - Android</h2>
  <hr />
<h2 id="android-programming">Android Programming</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Android runs in Dalvik VM.  Runtime for Java, optimized for mobile</li>
  <li>Basic architecture (descending order)
<img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l3_img1.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="activities">Activities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A single screen with a UI (e.g. phone dialer)</li>
  <li>Independent units, work together to form a cohesive whole</li>
  <li>Create an activity by extending the Activity class in the Android framework</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A component that performas a usually long-running activity in the background, not interacting with the user.
    <ul>
      <li>No UI, obviously</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a service by extending the Service class in the Android framework</li>
  <li>A way to tell the system something needs to keep happening even if app is closed</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="content-provider">Content Provider</h3>
<ul>
  <li>provides a structured interface to a set of data</li>
  <li>sqlite data is android setup for database.  frequently this is where you tie to with content provider</li>
  <li>sometimes also used by app to share data with other apps
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. address book / contacts app sharing with other apps that want it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="broadcast-receiver">Broadcast Receiver</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Receiver that can be registered to receive system or application events</li>
  <li>sounds like a ‘listener’ to me</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="intents">Intents</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Connect above components</li>
  <li>Abstract description of an operation to be performed</li>
  <li>consists of 2 main parts
    <ol>
      <li>action to be performed (e.g. “call”)</li>
      <li>data action operates on (e.g. “phone number”)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Provide developers with a way to perform late binding between applications at runtime</li>
  <li>How can this be done?
    <ul>
      <li>Binding
        <ol>
          <li>direct(activity)</li>
          <li>direct(service)</li>
          <li>broadcast (delivered to all receivers)
            <ul>
              <li>this is why when you click a phone number you have to pick which app takes it.  you broadcasted a call intent and each receiver chimed in that it could take it</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manifests">Manifests</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An XML file that declares all of the components of your app (broadcast receivers can be declared either here or at runtime)</li>
  <li>All the permissions required for your app to work</li>
  <li>Specifies the entry point for your app (which activity must be started to start the app)</li>
  <li>Declares version of the app</li>
  <li>Declares the lowest Android SDK for which the app is valid</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="android-activity-lifecycle">Android Activity Lifecycle</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/sdp/p2l3_img2.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Apps get interrupted all the time.   Apps must be able to deal with this.  Gracefully if possible.</li>
</ul>
