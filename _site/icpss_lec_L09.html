  <h2>ICPSS Lecture Notes - Lesson 9 - Industrial Network Protocols</h2>
  <h1 id="industrial-network-protocols">Industrial Network Protocols</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Highly specialized protocols, designed for efficiency and reliability</li>
  <li>Common requirements include:
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time synchronization</li>
      <li>Deterministic communication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many of these protocols forego security in order to meet ICS requirements</li>
  <li>Protocols deployed across Industrial networks
    <ul>
      <li>Including WAN, business networks, plant and SCADA networks, and fieldbus networks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many of these protocols were only over serial channels, but have now evolved to work over ethernet using routable protocols</li>
  <li>For the most part, we can divide industrial protocols into two common categories
    <ul>
      <li>Fieldbus</li>
      <li>Backend</li>
      <li>We’ll also discuss another which doesn’t fit into either bucket</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fieldbus-vs-backend-protocols">Fieldbus vs Backend Protocols</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Commonly found in process and control</li>
  <li>Deployed to connect sensors and actuators to PLCs, and PLCs to supervisory systems such as HMIs</li>
  <li>Backend protocols commonly deployed on or above supervisory networks, and are used to provide efficient system-to-system communication</li>
  <li>We’ll dive into 5 common prococols
    <ul>
      <li>Fieldbus
        <ul>
          <li>Modicon Communication Bus (Modbus)</li>
          <li>Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Backend
        <ul>
          <li>Open Process Communications (OPC)</li>
          <li>Inter-Control Center Protocol (ICCP)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Other
        <ul>
          <li>IEC 61850</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modbus">Modbus</h2>
<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img1.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Invented in 1979 by Modicon to enable PLCs to communicate with real-time computers</li>
  <li>Very widely supported</li>
  <li>Communicates raw messages without authentication or excessive overhead (obviously bad practice by modern standards)</li>
  <li>Application layer protocol (Layer 5 in TCP/IP stack)</li>
  <li>Request-response protocol
    <ul>
      <li>3 separate PDUs
        <ul>
          <li>Modbus request</li>
          <li>Modbus response</li>
          <li>Modbus exception response</li>
          <li><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img2.png" alt="img" /></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Commands are addressed to specific modbus address.  While other devices may receive the message, only the addressed device will respond.</li>
  <li>Data housed in 4 tables, exact implementation is device-specific
    <ul>
      <li><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img3.png" alt="img" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="variants">Variants</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Modbus RTU and Modbus ASCII
    <ul>
      <li>Support binary and ascii transmissions over serial buses, respectively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modbus TCP
    <ul>
      <li>designed to operate on modern networks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modbus Plus
    <ul>
      <li>designed to extend the reach of modbus for intereconnected buses using token-passing techniques</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Examples of PDUs for the variants.  Many differences, as seen here</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-concerns">Security Concerns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of Authentication
    <ul>
      <li>Only require use of a valid address, function code, and associated data</li>
      <li>Very simple MITM and Replay vulnerabilities here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lack of encryption
    <ul>
      <li>Modbus addresses sent in the clear</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lack of message checksum (Modbus/TCP only)</li>
  <li>Lack of broadcast suppression
    <ul>
      <li>(serial Modbus only used in a multidrop topology)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-recommendations">Security Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only use between sets of known devices using expected function codes</li>
  <li>Monitor communication with ICS-aware intrusion detection system</li>
  <li>Whitelisting</li>
  <li>Application aware firewall for more critical areas to validate modbus sessions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distributed-network-protocol">Distributed Network Protocol</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Began as a serial protocol much like modbus</li>
  <li>Designed for use between “master stations” or “control stations” and slave devices called “outstations”</li>
  <li>Commonly used to connect RTUs configured as “master stations” to IED “outstations” in electric substations</li>
  <li>Introduced in 1990 by Westronic</li>
  <li>Primary motivation for DNP3 was to provide reliable communications in environments common within the electirc utility industry that include high level of electromagnetic interference (EMI)
    <ul>
      <li>Much higher degree of reliability than other industrial protocols</li>
      <li>Accomplished in part with many CRCs
        <ul>
          <li>CRC is “Cyclic Redundancy Check” <a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/cyclic-redundancy-check-crc/">explained here</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>DNP3 was extended to work over IP via encapsulation in TCP or UDP packets in 1998</li>
  <li>Now widely used in not only electirc utility, but also oil and gas, water, and wastewater industries</li>
  <li>Reasons for industry migration from Modbus are f[eatures used by other industries such as:
    <ul>
      <li>report by exception</li>
      <li>data quality indicators</li>
      <li>timestamp data</li>
      <li>2-pass “select before operate” procedure on outputs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>More reliable than Modbus while remaining efficient and well-suited for real-time uses</li>
  <li>Utilizes several standardized data formats and utilizes timestamps for synchronization of data</li>
  <li>Unlike Modbus and ICCP, DNP3 is bidirectional
    <ul>
      <li>Therefore possible for a substation to initiate and inform the master station of events outside the norm</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img8.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sits at application layer of TCP/IP stack.
    <ul>
      <li>Has its own stack within the application, as shown in image above, corresponding to TCP stack, to offer features at each layer as appropriate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img9.png" alt="img" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Retransmission for CRC failure is ensured with multiple CRC embeddings withing header and payload</li>
  <li>DNP3 supports both static and event data, with classes thereof, for finer-grained and more efficient communication</li>
  <li>Provides a method to identify the remote device’s parameters to identify incoming messages and compare them to known point data
    <ul>
      <li>This is efficient because it only requires the master to interact with relevant/changed data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request/response/ack communication pattern, as in other protocols.  Multiple versions thereof
    <ul>
      <li>Also supports unsolicited responses from outstations and “confirm ack” requests from master station</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Walkthrough of some pcaps of DNP3traffic</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="secure-dnp3">Secure DNP3</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img10.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Standard DNP3 does not provide any security.  Secure DNP3 is a variant that adds authentication to the request/response process</li>
  <li>Challenge occurs on session initiation, potentially after a preset period of time, or on upon a critical request</li>
  <li>Uses a unique session key hashed together from information from both the sender and the challenger</li>
  <li>If using TCP, can also leverage TLS for encryption</li>
  <li>Thus, Secure DNP3 adds authentication, and if using TLS also adds confidentiality</li>
  <li>Often used between master control and an RTU, or between an RTU and different IEDs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-concerns-of-regular-dnp3">Security Concerns of Regular DNP3</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of authentication</li>
  <li>Lack of inherent encryption</li>
  <li>Fairly easy to manipulate due to well-defined nature of actions in the protocol</li>
  <li>Several vulns have been discovered and reported</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process-fieldbus-profibus">Process Fieldbus (PROFIBUS)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Originally developed in the late 1980s</li>
  <li>Initially designed primarily to allow PLCs to communicate with host computers</li>
  <li>Several variants exist
    <ul>
      <li>Profibus PA
        <ul>
          <li>for instrumentation used for process automation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Profisafe
        <ul>
          <li>for safety applications</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Profidrive
        <ul>
          <li>for high-speed drive applications</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Profibus DP (decentralized periphery)
        <ul>
          <li>Most widely deployed.  Itself has three variants</li>
          <li>DP-V0</li>
          <li>DP-V1</li>
          <li>DP-V2</li>
          <li>Each of these is a minor evolutionary step forward</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Three profiles for Profibus communication
        <ul>
          <li>asynchronous</li>
          <li>synchronouse</li>
          <li>via Ethernet using ethertype 0x8892
            <ul>
              <li>Profibus over Ethernet is also called PROFINET</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img11.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>A master-slave protocol that supports multiple master nodes through the use of  token sharing</li>
  <li>when a master has control of the token it can communicate with its slaves</li>
  <li>each slave is configured to respond to a single master</li>
  <li>slaves can initiate communication to master or to other slaves in the right conditions</li>
  <li>A master node is usually a PLC or RTU and a slave is usually a sensor or motor (or some other similar small component)</li>
  <li>Supports several physical layer deployments
    <ul>
      <li>Abide by concept of intrinsic safety, meaning power levels too low to ignite fires</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-concerns-1">Security Concerns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PROFIBUS lacks authentication inherent to many of its functions, allowing a spoofed node to impersonate a master node, which in turn provides control over all configured slaves</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-recommendations-1">Security Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PROFIBUS DP is a naturally segmented serial network</li>
  <li>Normally contained within a small geographical area, such as a section of a plant or manufacturing process</li>
  <li>Thus physical security is the main concern</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="industrial-ethernet-protocols">Industrial Ethernet Protocols</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Industrial Ethernet is the adaptation of the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard to real-time industrial automation applications</li>
  <li>General Ethernet does not provide QoS, so this is needed to allow real-time use</li>
  <li>One primary objective was to move toward more “synchronous” mechanisms of communication to prevent data collisions and minimize jitter inherent with “asynchronous” communications like standard Ethernet
    <ul>
      <li>Allows technology to be deployed in critical, time-dependent applications</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Also provides physical enhancements to “harden” the office grade nature of standard Ethernet
    <ul>
      <li>ruggedized wiring, connectors, and hardware</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img12.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>There are 30 different varieties of Industrial Ethernet.  We will discuss 5 (bolded above.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="profinet">Profinet</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img13.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for scalability.  Can be deployed across varying network conditions.  Each version improved reliability and cycle time speed.</li>
  <li>Security concerns
    <ul>
      <li>Profinet is a real-time ethernet procotol, and as such is susceptible to any of the vulnerabilities of Ethernet</li>
      <li>Lack of authentication and inherent protocol vulnerability common to industrial protocols exacerbated by increased risk because this can be transmitted across standard enterprise and public networks (Ethernet is everywhere)</li>
      <li>Thus, Profinet TCP/IP should be tightly controlled.  Within less-trusted business networks, used only over authenticated and encrypted networks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ethercat">Ethercat</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img14.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Real-time Ethernet-based fieldbus protocol classified as “Industrial Ethernet”</li>
  <li>Messages can either be transmitted directly as an Ethernet frame, or encapsulated as a UDP payload</li>
  <li>Communicates large amounts of distributed process data with a single Ethernet frame
    <ul>
      <li>This is good for efficiency because it means few cycles to communicate entire corpus of data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security concerns
    <ul>
      <li>As expected, susceptible to all vulnerabilities of standard Ethernet</li>
      <li>EtherCAT is sensitive and highly susceptible to DOS attacks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security Recommendations
    <ul>
      <li>secure perimiter</li>
      <li>passive network monitoring with whitelisting of devices</li>
      <li>ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ethernet-powerlink">Ethernet Powerlink</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img15.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Directly encapsulates ethernet frames</li>
  <li>Cyclic polling of slave devices by a master node</li>
  <li>Multiple phases
    <ul>
      <li>Start of Control</li>
      <li>Isochronous phase
        <ul>
          <li>Slaves respond only if they receive a poll, preserving sequencing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Asynchronous phase
        <ul>
          <li>allows larger, non-time-critical data to be transmitted</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Process repeats</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security concerns
    <ul>
      <li>As expected, susceptible to all vulnerabilities of standard Ethernet</li>
      <li>Ethernet Powerlink is sensitive and highly susceptible to DOS attacks</li>
      <li>Easily disrupted via the insertion of rogue Ethernet frames into the network, requiring the separation of Powerlink from other Ethernet systems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security Recommendations
    <ul>
      <li>Require a clear demarcation from other networks, needed by protocol anyway.  Thus establish appropriate zones</li>
      <li>ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sercos-iii-serial-real-time-communication-system">SERCOS III (Serial Real-Time Communication System)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For communication between industrial controls, motion devices, and IO devices</li>
  <li>V1 and V2 were based on fiber optic ring, v3 is Ethernet-based</li>
  <li>Works directly on ethernet frames</li>
  <li>Supports many straight and rign topologies</li>
  <li>Master-slave protocol operating cyclically in which a single master synch telegram is used to communicate with slaves.
    <ul>
      <li>Slaves are given a specific time in which they can place their information on the bus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img16.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>All messages for all nodes are packaged into a master data telegram (MDT)
    <ul>
      <li>Each node knows which portion of the MDT it should read based on a pre-determined byte allocation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Allocation Telegram (AT) is issued by master but populated by each slave with their appropriate response data.
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple slaves share same AT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unified Communication (UC) phase the SERCOS network is open to allow ethernet frames or TCP/UDP traffic from other such devices</li>
  <li>Security concerns
    <ul>
      <li>As expected, susceptible to all vulnerabilities of standard Ethernet</li>
      <li>SERCOS III is sensitive and highly susceptible to DOS attacks</li>
      <li>Through the UC Channel, also shares all vulnerabilities of enabled protocols, and can be used to attack other networks such as enterprise or industrial</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security Recommendations
    <ul>
      <li>Network isolation is critical</li>
      <li>SERCOS III should only be used on control loops that definitively require it</li>
      <li>IP Channels (UC Channel phase) should be restricted, or avoided if at all possible
        <ul>
          <li>If used, the IP channels should be enclosed within zones consisting of SERCOS III master node and only required IP devices</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="backend-protocols">Backend Protocols</h2>
<h3 id="open-process-communication">Open Process Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>OPC is not actually an industrial protocol, but instead a series of standards specifications</li>
  <li>Designed to provied a higher level of integration between systems and subsystems than a fieldbus protocol</li>
  <li>Motivated by needs of end users, as opposed to vendors, for interacting with different industrial devices</li>
  <li>OPC’s strengths and weaknesses come from its foundation
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft OLE is a big foundation</li>
      <li>Allows for data presentation to be separate from the application that generated it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img17.png" alt="img" />
<img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img18.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Client-server functional pattern.</li>
  <li>Client calls to server, process executes on server
    <ul>
      <li>Uses RPC for calls</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Used in industrial networks, across many different use cases, to greatly simplify integration across devices</li>
  <li>Security Concerns
    <ul>
      <li>OPC’s use of DCOM and RPC makes it highly vulnerable to attack using multiple vectors
        <ul>
          <li>Shared attack surface with OLE, which is a very popular target</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>OPC hosted on unsupported OS’s adds additional risk</li>
      <li>Many basic host security concerns apply because OPC is supported on Windows</li>
      <li>OPC host account on OS presents a big risk if overpriviliged, especially as it will be shared across hosts</li>
      <li>Basically, this is a modern tool on a (relatively) modern platform, so it’s a casualty of all the other threats targeting that platform</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security Recommendations
    <ul>
      <li>The newer and designed for security Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) specifications should be used where possible</li>
      <li>Use best practices, as applied to any other windows box</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inter-control-center-communications-protocol-iccp">Inter-control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for communication between control centers within the electric utility industry</li>
  <li>Classified as a backend protocol because it was designed for bidirectional, WAN communication between control centers</li>
  <li>A standardized, common protocol was needed for communication between these disparate control centers which often do different functions and have different owners.</li>
  <li>Uses a master(client)-slave(server) model, with request/response pattern
    <ul>
      <li>Primarily unidirectional, but modern implementations often allow hosts to function as both client and server creating a pseudo-bidirectional pattern</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Operates over almost any network protocol, but commonly uses ISO transport</li>
  <li>Effectively a point-to-point protocol due to use of bilateral table acting as an ACL for each control center</li>
  <li>Security Concerns
    <ul>
      <li>ICCP lacks authentication and encryption and is therefore susceptible to any number of attacks (spoofing, session hijacking, etc)
        <ul>
          <li>There is a Secure ICCP variant that incorporates digital certificate auth and crypt, but it is not widely used.  It should be</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Explicitly defined trust relationships can be exploited
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. if bilateral tables get compromised, the jig is entirely up</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Too accessible, as a WAN protocol.  Lots of attack surface on WAN (e.g. WAN)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security Recommendations
    <ul>
      <li>Secure ICCP variants should be used wherever possible and supported by the current vendors installed within a particular site</li>
      <li>Patch and update, there are lots of known vulns for ICCP so leaving old versions up running across WAN is just asking for it.</li>
      <li>Extreme care should be taken in the definition of the bilateral table.  It’s the firewall, any mistakes here are a big problem</li>
      <li>Standard modern best practices.</li>
      <li>ICS-aware firewalls and/or IDS</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="iec-61850-standard">IEC 61850 Standard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Doesn’t cleanly fit into either Fieldbus or Backend categories</li>
  <li>International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 61850 was originally conceived for substation automation</li>
  <li>The design concepts are being incorporated throughout the generation, transmission, and distribution areas of the power industry and may even see adoption in the consumer/load component
    <ul>
      <li>Extended to domains beyond isolated substation automation</li>
      <li>We will discuss in its original context, but these concepts are applicable wherever the standard is</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For almost 20 years, comms were done using coper wires and legacy protocols described above.
    <ul>
      <li>This generally sucked, for a variety of reasons</li>
      <li>Ethernet has helped with some of this, but a broader solution was needed.</li>
      <li>Enter 61850</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First version of 61850 was released in 2005 with several broad goals
    <ul>
      <li>Single complete standard for the equipment and related data in a substation:
        <ul>
          <li>configuring</li>
          <li>monitoring</li>
          <li>reporting</li>
          <li>storing</li>
          <li>communicating</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aimed to permit interoperability of equipment afrom different manufacturers.
    <ul>
      <li>Further, common format for this equipment’s data and configs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Has a data and communications model</li>
  <li>Designed to run on top of a standard Ethernet LAN
    <ul>
      <li>Can be either coper or fiber, but fiber is preferred for multiple reasons</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Defines two communication buses
    <ul>
      <li>Process bus
        <ul>
          <li>sends power systems information from CV/VT/Transducers to HMIs or PLCs or IEDs</li>
          <li>very sensitive to delay, so very high throughput</li>
          <li>Often has redundant components to ensure high availability</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Station bus
        <ul>
          <li>connects all the IEDs to each other and to a router for external communication</li>
          <li>used for less sensitive data compared to process bus, but still built for HA</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img20.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Communications protocols can be classified into 3 different groups
    <ul>
      <li>machine to machine
        <ul>
          <li>based on generic substation event (GSE)
            <ul>
              <li>a peer to peer layer 2 protocol that multicasts events to multiple devics, typically IED to IEDs
                <ul>
                  <li>Further divided into:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Generic Substation State Events (GSSE)
                        <ul>
                          <li>Seldom used</li>
                          <li>Only state events</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE)
                        <ul>
                          <li>Most common</li>
                          <li>Any event.  In practice, all events.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>client server</li>
      <li>configuration protocols</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The 61850 standard does not include security specifications of its own
    <ul>
      <li>defers to IEC 62351-6</li>
      <li>IEC 62351 provides security specifications for substation communications and is broken down into several parts
        <ul>
          <li>62351-3 requries TLS for all TCP/IP based communications, as well as node and message authentication</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Encryption is not supported because it would be impossible to maintain GOOSE’s 4ms performance requirement, so VLANs are used for protection
        <ul>
          <li>This is not really secure.  VLAN ID spoofing would allow an attacker to hop between VLANs, bypassing these Layer 3 controls</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/icpss/L09_img21.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>The attack surface here is huge, and once compromised lots of traversal is possible</li>
  <li>AMI has lots of features that are very promising, remote everything basically</li>
  <li>Smart grid has introduced new protocols in the “Home Area Network” or HAN space</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-concerns-2">Security Concerns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AMI
    <ul>
      <li>it’s an extremely large network that touches many other networks.  lots of attack surface</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The security concerns of the smart grid are numerous</li>
  <li>Smart grid protocols vary widely in their inherent security and vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Smart meters are readily accessible, and therefore require board-level and chip-level protections</li>
  <li>Neighborhood, home, and business LANs can be used as ingress to the AMI and as a target from the AMI</li>
  <li>Smart grids are ultimately interconnected with critical power generation, transmission, and distribution systems</li>
  <li>Smart grids represent a very juicy target to a variety of threat actors</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-recommendations-2">Security Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Risk and threat analysis before smart grid deployments, in their planning stages
    <ul>
      <li>similarly, assessment of the end users who will be connected to the grid, as they represent an attack vector</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clear delineation, separation of services, and the establishment of strong defense-in-depth at the perimeters</li>
</ul>
