      <li>DNS for finding IP addresses from symbolic names</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>A network that can reach every other network through peering

<ul>
  <li>Connectionless
    <ul>
      <li>Unreliable, best effort only.  No guarantee there</li>

  </li>
  <li>Typical route uses several hops
    <ul>
      <li>No ordering or delivery gaurantees across or between these hops</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Routing
    <ul>
      <li>IP host knows location of router (gateway)</li>
      <li>IP gateway must know route to other networks</li>

    <ul>
      <li>True</li>
    </ul>

      <li>True</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ip-authentication">IP Authentication</h3>
<ul>

  </li>
  <li>Problem: No Source IP authentication
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone who owns their machine can send packets with arbitrary source IP, and a response will be sent back to forged source IP</li>
      <li>Enables anonymous DoS attacks</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="tcp-basic-security-problesm">TCP Basic Security Problesm</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Network packets pass by untrusted hosts
    <ul>
      <li>Eavesdropping, packet sniffing</li>
      <li>Especially easy when attacker controls a machine close to the victim (e.g. WiFi routers)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TCP state easily obtained by eavesdropping
    <ul>
      <li>Enables spoofing and session hijacking</li>

<h3 id="tcp-security-quiz">TCP Security Quiz</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>True</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data link controls can protect connections comrpised of multiple links</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="random-initial-sequence-numbers">Random Initial Sequence Numbers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In TCP handshake, the first packet from client and server have their sequence number randomly generated</li>
  <li>This matters because if those numbers were predictable, an attacker could create a TCP session on behalf of a forged source IP address</li>
  <li>Breaks IP- ased authentication (e.g. SPF, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/hosts</code>)
    <ul>
      <li>Random sequence numbers do not prevent this attack, but they make it harder
<img src="../assets/content_images/omscs/netsec/L08_img7.png" alt="img" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-dos-vulnerability-reset">Example DoS Vulnerability: Reset</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attacker sends a Reset packet on an open socker</li>
  <li>If correct SNs then connection will close, denying service to the spoofed victim
    <ul>
      <li>Naively, probability of success is 1/232 (32-bit seq #s), but many systems allow for a large window of acceptable sequence numbers.  This gives a much higher success probability</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attcker an just flood with RST packets until one works</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protocols-quiz">Protocols Quiz</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems

      <li>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</li>
      <li>Handles routing between AS’s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Protocol designed to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol
    <ul>
      <li>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</li>
      <li>Handles discovering IP addresses for MAC addresses, using MAC broadcast.
        <ul>
          <li>Requests from gateway to LAN as MAC broadcast</li>
          <li>Response from hosts on LAN to gateway with their IP addresses, thus binding the IP address to their MAC address</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Protocol uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior routing protocols
    <ul>
      <li>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</li>
      <li>Handles routing within AS’s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="routing-security-interdomain-routing">Routing Security: Interdomain Routing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Autonomous System: Connected group of one or more Internet Protocol preficxes under a single routing policy (aka domain)</li>
  <li>Within-AS routing is handled by OSPF</li>
  <li>Between-AS routing is handled by BGP</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="arp-security">ARP Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ARP is a broadcast protocol</li>
  <li>Local network attacks
    <ul>
      <li>Node A can confuse a gateway into sending it traffic intended for Node B just by responding with whatever IP address it wants to impersonate</li>
      <li>This grants Node A man in the middle status, and it can proxy traffic to Node B, reading/injecting whatever it wants</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bgp-security">BGP Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unauthenticated route updates
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone can cause entire Internet to send traffic for a victim IP to attacker’s address
        <ul>
          <li>Notorious example is the Pakistani attack on Youtube</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Anyone can inject advertisements for arbitrary routes</li>
      <li>Advertisement will propagate everywhere</li>
      <li>Used for DoS, spam, and eavesdropping (details in DDoS lecture L02)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bgp-attacks-quiz">BGP Attacks Quiz</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unmasking the AS relationships by hacking the routing table
    <ul>
      <li>Revelation of network topologies</li>

  <li>Not yet used by hackers because damage cannot be contained.  It can blowback to the attacker
    <ul>
      <li>Creating route instabilities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The first step is to hijack traffic from a legitimate host
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a false route or kill a legitimate one
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The attacker must control a device along the victim’s communication path
    <ul>
      <li>Sniffing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bgp-security-solutions">BGP Security Solutions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RPKI: AS obtains a certificate (rout origination authority – ROA) from regional authority (RIR) and attaches ROA to path advertisement
    <ul>
      <li>Advertisements without a valid ROA are ignored</li>
      <li>Defends against a malicious AS (but not a network attacker)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SBGP: sign every hop of a path advertisement</li>
