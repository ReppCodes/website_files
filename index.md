### Welcome!
Hi, my name is Andrew. This is my personal website, where I house articles about my pet projects, class notes, miscellaneous ramblings, and whatever else I feel like.  All opinions expressed here are my own and not representative of my employer or affiliates.  Enjoy your stay, I hope you find something to interest you!

### Who am I?
I'm a computer nerd with a variety of interests.  

* I work as a data scientist in the healthcare space.  Lots and lots of SQL and Python.  Some DAX too when the situation demands.
* I am currently a student at Georga Tech in the OMSCS program.  I'm incredibly proud to be part of that institution.
* I really enjoy cybersecurity and CTFs.  I take runs at HackTheBox whenever I find some free time.  I hope to continue to develop my chops in this arena.
