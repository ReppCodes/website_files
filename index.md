### Welcome!
Hi, my name is Andrew. This is my personal website, where I house articles about my pet projects, class notes, miscellaneous ramblings, and whatever else I feel like.  All opinions expressed here are my own and not representative of my employer or affiliates.  Enjoy your stay, I hope you find something to interest you!

### Who am I?
I'm a computer nerd with a variety of interests.  

* I currently work as a Software Engineer on a distributed SQL database project.  It's a fork of PostgreSQL, my specific areas of interest are backup/restore and the core server code.  Piles of `go` and `c`, and I love it.
* My previous gig was at a cybersecurity startup, mostly focusing on backend stuff.  Python, Javascript, Redis, regexes for days.
* Prior to working in software I worked as a data scientist in the healthcare space, for about 10 years.
* I completed my MSCS at Georga Tech in Fall 2022. I specialized in Computing Systems, with a good amount of infosec coursework mixed in. I'm incredibly proud to have been part of that institution.
