### Welcome!
Hi, my name is Andrew. This is my personal website, where I house articles about my pet projects, class notes, miscellaneous ramblings, and whatever else I feel like.  All opinions expressed here are my own and not representative of my employer or affiliates.  Enjoy your stay, I hope you find something to interest you!

### Who am I?
I'm a computer nerd with a variety of interests. I've been nursing a deep interest in databases for many years now, and have both worked on their internals and used them in anger.

* I'm currently at Cloudflare, working on database-oriented products for the workers storage team. Check out [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/), it's pretty neat!
* I previously worked as a software engineer at VMware, working on the Greenplum Kernel R&D Team.  Greenplum is a fork of PostgreSQL, redesigned to specialize in distributed, petabyte-scale OLAP use cases. My specific areas of responsibility were backup/restore and the core server code. I primarily used `go` and `c`, and had a blast on the team.
* Prior to working in software I worked as a data scientist in the healthcare space, for about 7 years. I wrote a lot of SAS and Python, across several different areas.
* I completed my MSCS at Georgia Tech in Fall 2022. I specialized in Computing Systems, with a good amount of infosec coursework mixed in. I'm incredibly proud to have been part of that institution.
