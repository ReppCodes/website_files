title: CS6200 Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems
---

For Fall 2020, my fourth semester, I chose to take CS6200: Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems.  This class teaches the functions, abstractions, and design theory of operating systems.  It offers a good balance of theoretical coverage with practical examples from (mostly Unix-based) modern OS's.

The practical coverage is augmented with rather large and complex projects in C and C++.  Comfort with these languages is suggested as a prerequisite for the class, though I chose to jump in and try to pick that up as I went.  This may have contributed to my assessment of the projects, honestly.  The first project is to implement a socket-based file transfer protocol, complete with header parsing and support for multi-threading.  The second project is to implement a proxy server and cache server, which communicate via shared memory.  The third project has not yet been assigned, check back later this Fall for updates!
