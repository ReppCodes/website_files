title: CS6210 Advanced Operating Systems
---

For Spring 2021, my fifth semester, I chose to take CS6210: Advanced Operating Systems.  This class addresses a broad range of topics in operating system design and implementation, including:
* Operating system structuring
* Synchronization, communication and scheduling in parallel systems
* Distributed systems, their communication mechanisms, distributed objects and middleware
* Failures and recovery management
* System support for Internet-scale computing

I chose to take this class due to my ongoing interest in systems programming, low-level design, and optimization.  It also followed quite well on having taken the Intro to OS course immediately prior, which will (hopefully) help reduce some of the remedial catch-up work I frequently need to do given my non-traditional background in CS.

The theoretical material in the lectures and exams is augmented with rather large and complex projects in C and C++.  There are four of these projects:
* Project 1: Virtual Machine Scheduling in KVM
* Project 2: Barrier Synchronization
* Project 3: Distributed Service using GRPC
* Project 4: Implement MapReduce Framework using GRPC
